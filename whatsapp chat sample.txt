26/04/22, 11:46 am - +91 80876 92627: False positive brother

26/04/22, 6:45 pm - +91 6351 255 053: Solution for resolving the Internet when you are unable to open netacess.iim.ac.in (or technically you are not assigned an ip by DHCP client):

For Windows:
Step 0: Open CMD
Step 1: type ipconfig/release
Step 2: type ipconfig/renew
Step 3: type ipconfig and check under ethernet adapter in ipv4 heading whether ip is starting from 192 or 172 or is it something else. If it is something else then your internet has started working if not then repeat step 1 and step 2 once again. 

For Linux:
Step 0: Open the terminal
Step 1: type ifconfig
Step 2: there will be various heading like eth01, lo etc. Check for heading like eth01(some may have eth02 etc). Basically finding the interface for ethernet
Step 3: sudo dhclient -r eth0
Step 4: sudo dhclient eth0
(Here inplace of eth0, you can replace it by your ethernet interface)
Step 5: Check in ifconfig, in the required ethernet interface the ip. If it is not a 192 or 17, something then your internet has started working.

Problem: The problem is with DHCP server which assigns us the ip. It is not able to provide it properly. Easiest solution to fix that in server end is to get the dhcp server to restart. 

These might work!!

I have been complaining the concern people from past six days about internet issue in room. Only once they have come and unfortunately the internet was working fine then. I explained then that it world only for some time, they ignored me and ran at rocket speed saying net is fine. In hostels like this one, phone network is also very week... So I ask suggestions that what shall I do.. Whom to complain?

26/04/22, 10:03 pm - +91 6203 329 502: thanks 👍
26/04/22, 10:05 pm - +91 88594 08799: 😊🤝
26/04/22, 10:10 pm - +91 99436 77801: There is no power supply to the network switch in the second floor. It is from here that lan is routed to the right wing of first and second floor. This is why many of us are not getting internet. I guess the MCB would have tripped. We have to ask the manager to check in the morning!
26/04/22, 10:11 pm - +91 88594 08799: Ohh that's the reason
26/04/22, 10:34 pm - +91 95855 71750: We can turn on the mcb by ourselves.
26/04/22, 10:34 pm - +91 95855 71750: Where is the nearest mcb room??
26/04/22, 10:34 pm - +91 88594 08799: Yes where it is?
27/04/22, 7:42 am - +91 99436 77801: Yes we can. But, I didn't find any MCB nearby. Heard that there is a common electrical room in ground floor with all the control.
27/04/22, 7:46 am - +91 99626 09717: There is an electrical room next to the wash areas on all floors. Back before Covid started, there were quite a few instances when I would talk to the Security section at 9999 to ask them to instruct the security guards of our hostel to open the rooms so that we can access the MCB ourselves, in the middle of the night. (The guards would usually have the key. By default, they are instructed to not use them.)
27/04/22, 7:50 am - +91 99626 09717: However, this isn't usually recommended by the Electrical section of IITM, as the tripping may be a safeguard against the *rare* case of getting a shortcircuit fire.

However, I think that in most of the cases, tripping happens just due to some heavy appliances that residents might be using (such as induction stoves, iron, etc.), in which case, turning back on the MCB is the simplest solution.
27/04/22, 7:51 am - +91 99436 77801: Okay
27/04/22, 7:52 am - +91 99436 77801: That's right. We will check with the manager today and get it fixed. We should be calling Electrical complaints? (04422578187)
27/04/22, 7:59 am - +91 80876 92627: I have damaged my laptop in hostel due to electrical fluctuations. So be careful in whatever you guys do.
27/04/22, 8:01 am - +91 99626 09717: Yup
27/04/22, 8:01 am - +91 80876 92627: Also, induction and iron boxes are not allowed. If found CCW will acquire it.
27/04/22, 8:01 am - +91 99626 09717: They are available 24x7.
27/04/22, 8:02 am - +91 99626 09717: Yeah, that's the written rule. (People still use such appliances, though, while keeping their doors closed. Those who get caught are imposed with fines of even up to 5000, from what I have heard.)
27/04/22, 8:03 am - +91 99626 09717: "They" being folks at electrical complaints.
27/04/22, 8:03 am - +91 80876 92627: Yes 😂 more than the cost of appliances
27/04/22, 8:04 am - +91 99626 09717: Once upon a time, tower fans were not allowed.
When CCW realized that it is too much to ask students to melt in the heat of April-July, they started allowing the use of extra fans. But no changes have been made in the written rules.
27/04/22, 8:04 am - +91 99626 09717: (No changes, from what I know.)
27/04/22, 8:05 am - +91 80876 92627: Yea. That too only models that have fuses.
27/04/22, 8:05 am - +91 99626 09717: Yes! I forgot that point. Good that you have mentioned it for others to note.
27/04/22, 8:06 am - +91 80876 92627: For all new residents, do not use heavy appliances and by rule induction is now allowed. Don't use duplicate chargers. There have been incidences of short circuit and small scale fire as well.
27/04/22, 8:06 am - +91 99626 09717: not*
27/04/22, 8:07 am - +91 99626 09717: induction is not* allowed, I mean.
27/04/22, 8:10 am - +91 99436 77801: Hehe!! Tried calling them twice yesterday night!!
27/04/22, 8:10 am - +91 80876 92627: Yea 🙈 typo...

*Not* allowed
27/04/22, 8:24 am - +91 99626 09717: Oh.
Okay. In that case, we should try 9999 as the fallback option, if no one picks up.
27/04/22, 8:53 am - +91 89849 35693: Are they replying?
27/04/22, 9:29 am - +91 80013 64764: Yes
27/04/22, 9:50 am - +91 88853 66406: At which floor LAN is not working? Bcz i am thinking to send a mail to direct Dean..
27/04/22, 9:50 am - +91 96737 01493: 446
27/04/22, 9:51 am - +91 89849 35693: Right now 2nd floor 311

27/04/22, 9:55 am - +91 79087 55490: Thank you to that person who took out clothes from RR 17 Washing Machine. It actually got out of my mind.
27/04/22, 9:55 am - +91 88853 66406: I can't send a mail like a  particular room. If floor means whole students mails i can keep it n send mail to Dean. Is it ok to all?
27/04/22, 9:58 am - +91 99436 77801: 1st floor. Room 211
27/04/22, 10:04 am - +91 82400 01879: My floor no 5 at room 607 lan is not working
27/04/22, 10:11 am - +91 93435 34852: In ground floor it connected randomly after a wait of about 2 hours. If there's a power cut or if I restart my laptop, am not certain of getting internet again.
27/04/22, 10:13 am - +91 97002 76503: For electrical issue directly sending a mail to Dean will not be good...I think we must go through proper channel...starting from warden sir...then CCW chair then Dost
27/04/22, 10:13 am - +91 97002 76503: Moreover electrical maintenance is also a seperate unit
27/04/22, 10:19 am - +91 88853 66406: Yes venkatesh. Since issue not yet resolved. We r sending mails to them. No one is responding. Then what we can do except to send mail to Dean.
27/04/22, 10:20 am - +91 89849 35693: Iitm Net Service.vcf (file attached)
27/04/22, 10:20 am - +91 97002 76503: Oh if u have already send an email to everyone then u can send mail to dean✌🏻
27/04/22, 10:21 am - +91 88853 66406: I didn't send to everyone. I sent to service person only. Now, i am thinking to do it
27/04/22, 10:21 am - +91 88853 66406: Nitish, did u call to them?
27/04/22, 10:21 am - +91 97002 76503: Send through proper channel
27/04/22, 10:22 am - +91 97002 76503: 👍🏻
27/04/22, 10:22 am - +91 89849 35693: I got call from this number and he asked me to check the internet and 😀 it is was working.
He explained that there is an issue with the power and that can be sorted out if we can put UPS which can work during fluctuations
27/04/22, 10:22 am - +91 88853 66406: Now, is ur internet working?
27/04/22, 10:22 am - +91 89849 35693: UPS and electrical things can be provided by the hostel authority
27/04/22, 10:23 am - +91 89849 35693: <Media omitted>

27/04/22, 11:36 am - +91 95535 34691: It is fact that there are students in this IIT who are 18+(adults) and still don’t have the basic etiquettes.

27/04/22, 3:18 pm - +91 81458 31742: Ask in that group
27/04/22, 3:20 pm - Vishnu Ms: See recent mail.... Ccw/dost permission is needed
27/04/22, 3:57 pm - +91 79804 18220: No water on 3rd floor

27/04/22, 5:37 pm - +91 6203 329 502: no permission from DOST is required at the moment to go home and they are not granting permission to anyone except for some emergency medical reason... i talked with DOST Prof.  Nilesh Vasa he told GCC is not allowing any students to go outside the campus as of now
27/04/22, 5:39 pm - +91 74046 59903: Will the Hostle warden permission be sufficient or not?
27/04/22, 5:41 pm - +91 6203 329 502: no... in current situation permission from DOST is required to go home and DOST will give permission only after clearance from GCC... so warden plus DOST permission is required.
27/04/22, 5:48 pm - +91 6203 329 502: btw please ask and confirm it from warden also and let us know in the group... i didn't talk with warden sir.
27/04/22, 5:56 pm - +91 74046 59903: I got warden's permission; however today CCW/DOST email came, which created confusion.

27/04/22, 7:04 pm - +91 89849 35693: 😅
27/04/22, 7:14 pm - Rishabh Jambhulkar: We should mail to them that those who are negative should be allowed to go
27/04/22, 7:26 pm - +91 6203 329 502: we can try bro but management here is absolutely pathetic. tbey have given so much trouble to the students since pandemic... shifting hostels already 3-4 times (not to mention we have to shift again in August)...they are rigid and don't want to hear student's opinion
27/04/22, 7:27 pm - +91 80876 92627: Who told you about August?
27/04/22, 7:27 pm - +91 6203 329 502: this current allotment is upto august only
27/04/22, 7:27 pm - Rishabh Jambhulkar: I have messaged to student secretary.... That's why..... Let's see
27/04/22, 7:28 pm - Rishabh Jambhulkar: Atleast they should tell the dates of lockdown
27/04/22, 7:28 pm - +91 80876 92627: Bro this is PG hostel. And allotment also has been according to year of admission and department except for old students. Chances of shifting are less. Don't worry.
27/04/22, 7:29 pm - +91 80876 92627: Unless verified i suggest not to create confusion.
27/04/22, 7:30 pm - +91 94990 48210: yes i am prepared... since pandemic hostel change change hi khel rhe h bus...
27/04/22, 7:30 pm - +91 80876 92627: 😂 i can understand. I also suffered. But lets hope that they won't change.

Mostly change would be for people exceeding tenure/Mtechs
27/04/22, 7:31 pm - +91 70088 70428: Is net connection restored?
27/04/22, 7:32 pm - +91 94990 48210: lol😀 they shifted whole pampa to bhadra first... then whole Bhadra to tower hostel... mostly phd abd ms scholars... that's why i said pathetic management...
27/04/22, 7:33 pm - +91 89470 69850: That's true
27/04/22, 7:33 pm - +91 80876 92627: Yea that was because of quarantine center and painting work. Now painting has been done and quarantine is like self isolation in our own room
27/04/22, 7:33 pm - +91 89470 69850: We got Bhadra hostel
27/04/22, 7:36 pm - +91 6203 329 502: hostel se bahar mat jao...labs mat jao... hostel me continously interest work nhi kr rha from last few days... aur apne marji se ghar bhi nhi ja sakte ab to... to college me wapas aaye hi kyu room me pade rehne k liye bus... atleast they should allow whoever wants to return to their home
27/04/22, 7:36 pm - +91 93444 71836: Where is internet 😭
27/04/22, 7:37 pm - +91 87633 74318: Pathetic management.
This is happening because students are not United .

Logically if we see

Students are bared 
from entering academic zone 

But mess is crowded 

Usha is crowded 

Btech people are all roaming at night .....

But we can't go labs 🤷‍♂️
27/04/22, 7:38 pm - +91 87633 74318: Lockdown will not work any how and WHO itself tells based on severity this shd treated .

Most people are asymptomatic or it is like common cold
27/04/22, 7:39 pm - +91 83018 85364: Here lockdown is the biggest comedy🤣
27/04/22, 7:39 pm - +91 87633 74318: Day scholars , workers , faculty and all lab staff are coming 🤷‍♂️
27/04/22, 7:40 pm - +91 6203 329 502: i have friends in all iits. they are not implementing these illogical rules only on students...and let me tell you they are doing much better in handling covid pandemic. here management knowa only one thing that is blame the students for everything
27/04/22, 7:40 pm - +91 87633 74318: They can make a rule that people who are tested negetive can roam around
27/04/22, 7:40 pm - +91 87633 74318: And if the person has a severe cold can self isolate
27/04/22, 7:41 pm - +91 87633 74318: Anyways day scholars are accessing lab.
27/04/22, 7:42 pm - +91 87633 74318: Library is being accessed and Fully crowded but gyms are closed 🤷‍♂️
Hostel scholars are prevented from going to department🤦‍♂️
27/04/22, 7:42 pm - +91 87633 74318: Nothing makes sense 😒
27/04/22, 7:43 pm - +91 83018 85364: Actually we can go, right? No one will block us I think. The rules are for name sake.
27/04/22, 7:45 pm - +91 87633 74318: You can go.....
27/04/22, 7:45 pm - +91 95855 71750: +1
27/04/22, 7:45 pm - +91 6203 329 502: no we can't go... gates are closed... guards will allow only if we have dost permission... security guards told me these
27/04/22, 7:45 pm - +91 95855 71750: Yes
27/04/22, 7:45 pm - +91 87633 74318: Today's rule 
After dinner or lunch we need to come back within 45 mins
27/04/22, 7:46 pm - +91 87633 74318: 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
27/04/22, 7:48 pm - +91 6203 329 502: Pathetic and disgusting management. Saare rules and restrictions sirf hostel ke scholars le liye hi h... literally pichle do saal se management ne mentally disturb krke rakh diya h hostellers ko
27/04/22, 7:49 pm - +91 6203 329 502: this is torture... even those who are negative and want to voluntarily go home, arw denied permission.  pathetic
27/04/22, 7:50 pm - +91 87633 74318: Yeah chalega abhi bhai ....
27/04/22, 7:51 pm - +91 87633 74318: At most you can do is go to lab or somewhere else by making excuse
27/04/22, 7:51 pm - +91 95855 71750: Firstly we should focus on the internet issue. Atleast few ppl can sork from room... Those who are not working with hardware.
27/04/22, 7:52 pm - +91 79801 46926: In how many days do we get the covid test results ?
27/04/22, 7:52 pm - +91 95855 71750: Usually one day.
27/04/22, 7:54 pm - +91 79801 46926: Ok thanks.
But do we get sms for negative ?
27/04/22, 7:54 pm - +91 95855 71750: Nope.
27/04/22, 7:54 pm - +91 79801 46926: 🥲
27/04/22, 7:55 pm - +91 6203 329 502: after testing if you don't receive call from GCC next day by evening (they call only positive person), then report is negative
27/04/22, 8:01 pm - +91 90514 66830 left
27/04/22, 8:06 pm - +91 70039 54884: Whoever took the Comfort Liquid detergent (Red) from the washing machine near Room 501 please return it to room 501. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

I lost my wallet yesterday and in no position to buy another one right now.

Please return it whoever has it by mistake. 🙏🏻🙏🏻
27/04/22, 8:08 pm - +91 88853 66406: If we all agree, one thing we can do. We'll meet the Dean of students about facilities to students and this type of self isolation rules. What do you say guys?
27/04/22, 8:12 pm - +91 70088 70428: I am in
27/04/22, 8:12 pm - +91 88853 66406: Is it ok, tomorrow?
27/04/22, 8:14 pm - +91 88853 66406: I need ur support..

27/04/22, 8:14 pm - +91 97002 76503: Tomorrow i think the quarantine gets over
27/04/22, 8:14 pm - +91 88853 66406: Ok venkatesh. At least about LAN we can ask him
27/04/22, 8:15 pm - +91 97002 76503: But what help he can give
27/04/22, 8:15 pm - +91 97002 76503: LAN is related to PG senapathi
27/04/22, 8:16 pm - +91 88853 66406: Today, I talked with him(DoST). In front of me, he called that LAN person even though he didn't come here.. that's what I told u in the evening
27/04/22, 8:16 pm - +91 97002 76503: Ohh that's great
27/04/22, 8:16 pm - +91 97002 76503: Then we can go no problem
27/04/22, 8:16 pm - +91 88853 66406: His name Selvaraj sir
27/04/22, 8:16 pm - +91 97002 76503: I know
27/04/22, 8:17 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yeah. Definitely it will resolve if we'll meet him venkatesh
27/04/22, 8:17 pm - +91 97002 76503: He told me that only way to resolve network issue is by getting a ticket at helpdesknetworks@iitm.ac.in
27/04/22, 8:17 pm - +91 97002 76503: Ok
27/04/22, 8:18 pm - +91 88853 66406: I got na.. no problem we can convey to him. I need support.. I can convey it directly to him..
27/04/22, 8:19 pm - +91 97002 76503: ✌🏻
27/04/22, 8:19 pm - +91 97002 76503: We need people
27/04/22, 8:19 pm - +91 88853 66406: Hmm
27/04/22, 8:19 pm - +91 88853 66406: Our council also has to join us n students as well
27/04/22, 8:22 pm - +91 97002 76503: 👍🏻
27/04/22, 8:24 pm - +91 70039 54884: Just keep it outside the room 501🙏🏻
27/04/22, 8:32 pm - +91 95855 71750: I think this will work if it is an individual issue. Here the issue is for almost everyone one. Seems that there is some other problem in this hostel
27/04/22, 8:33 pm - +91 97002 76503: Yeah✌🏻
27/04/22, 9:04 pm - +91 82400 01879: I am facing the lan connection issue and they don't care to respond
27/04/22, 10:03 pm - +91 88537 00390: After 30 min I seen lots of message on group.i thought maybe there is some announcement. But in all messages one word is common LAN  connection... 😊😊.. LAN hay hay
27/04/22, 10:29 pm - +91 79804 18220: Hostel had taken a huge amount, why don't they provide a stable lan connection don't know
27/04/22, 10:35 pm - +91 93444 71836: Is internet working now?
27/04/22, 10:36 pm - +91 89849 35693: Nope
27/04/22, 10:37 pm - +91 93444 71836: I think morning they will come
27/04/22, 10:38 pm - +91 89849 35693: God knows😅

27/04/22, 10:49 pm - +91 85100 64198: This message was deleted
27/04/22, 10:55 pm - Vivek Ta: I haven't faced any serious net problems yet. Only slight slow net speed sometimes. But seeing that many of you raising such concerns regularly, there has to be something really wrong. Could be issue with the network switch hardware and its configuration (from CC side) or wrong configuration of network devices from student side. So to narrow down the actual issue and get a long-term solution, I would request the concerned students to raise a formal complaint/ticket as and when the issue occurs with required evidences (like screenshot of the error). This will directly involve the CC personnel to look into the issue. If frequent issues happens(I think now its happening), we can push CC networks through proper channel (Hostel committee-->Hostel Manager-->CCW) which can be more effective. In case, if such situation arise(lots of official complaints with correct description of the problem) this complaints will help network team to narrow down the issue quickly. So instead of writing messages about issues here which has a lesser impact, let us do the necessary things that will really help solve this issue.

If possible we can also form a team of students who knows more about the issue to investigate it from our side. This can also help to close this issue quickly.
27/04/22, 10:57 pm - +91 85100 64198: Did raise the issue yesterday night, recieved an email from helpdesk that everything is fine and I should check it from my side
27/04/22, 10:57 pm - Vivek Ta: But before raising I request the concerned student to go through the guidelines for configuration of personal devices and ensure the same. Else, that could weaken the complaint and also can have a negative impact.
27/04/22, 11:01 pm - Vivek Ta: *raising any complaints/tickets
27/04/22, 11:01 pm - +91 88594 08799: Due to unconfigured devices net speed can be
27/04/22, 11:02 pm - +91 88594 08799: Slow
27/04/22, 11:04 pm - +91 88594 08799: But whole blockage of internet may be  another issue ..are unconfigured devices  blocking internet?
27/04/22, 11:06 pm - Vivek Ta: Who have faced this whole network down issue??
27/04/22, 11:07 pm - +91 88594 08799: On 3rd floor there is no internet
27/04/22, 11:08 pm - Vivek Ta: Had everyone raised an official complaint?
27/04/22, 11:09 pm - Vivek Ta: 3 rd floor people???
27/04/22, 11:10 pm - +91 88594 08799: Yes i did 2 times
27/04/22, 11:10 pm - +91 88594 08799: Today itself also
27/04/22, 11:10 pm - +91 88594 08799: After 2 hr of my mail .. internet has started but from evening
27/04/22, 11:10 pm - +91 88594 08799: It got shutdown
27/04/22, 11:11 pm - Vivek Ta: If the issue persists, all the people who are facing please raise the ticket then and there with sufficient evidence.
27/04/22, 11:12 pm - +91 97002 76503: 👍🏻
27/04/22, 11:13 pm - Vivek Ta: Did anyone else raise complaint. If no one else have registered a complaint then the first thought will be you have some config issue in your device. You will fighting a lone battle.🙇‍♂️🙇‍♂️
27/04/22, 11:14 pm - Vivek Ta: *will be fighting
27/04/22, 11:22 pm - +91 88594 08799: 3rd floor people , why u r silent ?  If not getting internet then raise your voice .

28/04/22, 3:29 pm - +91 99514 56939: GCC extended the quarantine period till 2nd May 2022.
28/04/22, 3:30 pm - +91 99514 56939: Tunga hostel manager posted this on their group it seems
28/04/22, 3:34 pm - +91 80876 92627: For all hostels or Tunga?
28/04/22, 3:35 pm - +91 70251 40314: All hostels it Seems
28/04/22, 3:35 pm - +91 70251 40314: Tunga has no positive cases from last rtpcr
28/04/22, 3:35 pm - +91 99514 56939: That was not specific… but how can they restrict just one hostel.. might be for all
28/04/22, 3:36 pm - +91 99514 56939: Tunga girls are planning to protest it seems
28/04/22, 3:42 pm - Vivek Ta: After tightening the grip for last few days, surely GCC wouldn't want to loosen it during weekend.
28/04/22, 3:46 pm - +91 74046 59903: I went to GCC counter and asked regarding permission to go home... they said as first case was detected on 18th so 14 days incubation period is there... so till 2nd May nobody is allowed to go out or come inside campus. They are implementing it strictly this time it seems.
28/04/22, 3:56 pm - +91 79087 55490: https://report.icmr.org.in/

28/04/22, 4:01 pm - +91 6203 329 502: leave asymptomatic, they are even not allowing those who has negative rtpcr report to leave campus... this is mental torture...
28/04/22, 4:09 pm - +91 94860 87050: Covid is better than this fellows mental torture.

28/04/22, 4:13 pm - +91 6203 329 502: workers are allowed come and go in campus, staffs, profs, lab technicians,  day scholars all are allowed to go outside the campus if negative... only soft target is we the hostellers.  this is pathetic and beyond illogical
28/04/22, 4:13 pm - +91 82729 09591: GCC has gone bonkers
28/04/22, 4:13 pm - +91 97002 76503: This is only because there is no unity among the students or the student leaders...
28/04/22, 4:14 pm - +91 82729 09591: At least they could allow free movement inside the campus
28/04/22, 4:14 pm - +91 6203 329 502: no iits or any city corporation throughout india is implementing these type of illogical and absurd rules
28/04/22, 4:15 pm - +91 88853 66406: Send mail to Dean which has already got self isolation mail.

28/04/22, 4:17 pm - +91 94860 87050: GCC guideline for Asymptomatic "Contact" needs to be in 7 days isolation.
28/04/22, 4:17 pm - +91 94860 87050: But why 14 days for IIT only ?!
28/04/22, 4:18 pm - +91 6203 329 502: upar se yha hostel me roz roz Internet ka nautanki... room se bhi shi sr kaam nhi kr sakte... wapas aaye h college me sirf room me sone aur pade rehne k liye it seems

28/04/22, 4:24 pm - +91 6203 329 502: gcc knows everything that all these gathering is happening in mess... as i said only soft target is students in hostel

28/04/22, 4:40 pm - +91 94962 52205: ???
28/04/22, 4:41 pm - +91 80876 92627: Guys the food that we are getting at first floor Neelkesh is horrible as compared to even the worst mess in IIT in last 5 years. Don't hesitate to complain regarding quality. Ask for complaint book and give your complaint. CCW is of the view that students don't have complaint regarding food (probably because nobody is writing in the book)
28/04/22, 4:42 pm - +91 80876 92627: Only if we Pressure the caterer he will start giving better quality than this.
28/04/22, 4:42 pm - +91 94461 56991: I am dining at Himalaya 2nd floor SI
28/04/22, 4:43 pm - +91 80876 92627: Probably he didn't want to give me the permission to change that's why he told something randomly
28/04/22, 4:43 pm - +91 80876 92627: The food is not at all worth the money that we are paying.

28/04/22, 4:51 pm - +91 89470 69850: Yes its really bad. Even they are not following the menu. I asked for the complaint register multiple times but she said they have send the register to CCW
28/04/22, 4:54 pm - +91 89470 69850: We should ask ccw to change this caterer and get a new one
28/04/22, 4:54 pm - Vivek Ta: There is a QR code displayed at each mess to register any complaints, I think. You can use that too raise a complaint.
28/04/22, 4:54 pm - +91 89470 69850: 👍
28/04/22, 4:54 pm - +91 79087 55490: Nothing happens
28/04/22, 4:54 pm - +91 80876 92627: Yes. That's the point. Force them to give the complaint book. Of they are not giving let us know here. I will send email to CCW
28/04/22, 4:55 pm - +91 79087 55490: I have already complaint two times for Anjappar
28/04/22, 4:55 pm - +91 89470 69850: I asked 3 times
28/04/22, 4:55 pm - +91 79087 55490: No Fresh Chicken 
Dried Barbecue Chicken 
Paneer is Rubber
28/04/22, 4:55 pm - +91 80876 92627: Anjappar is even worst in quality.
28/04/22, 4:55 pm - +91 80876 92627: I agree.
28/04/22, 4:55 pm - +91 89470 69850: She made some stupid reasons that it not with her and called the manager
28/04/22, 4:56 pm - +91 89470 69850: He said they will make the changes
28/04/22, 4:56 pm - +91 80876 92627: Ok. I will try today once again. And directly email chairman and VC regarding this.
28/04/22, 4:56 pm - +91 89470 69850: But it never happened
28/04/22, 4:56 pm - +91 89470 69850: Yes
28/04/22, 4:56 pm - +91 79087 55490: I got Paratyphoid because of the stale Chicken
28/04/22, 4:56 pm - +91 80876 92627: Today's menu is paratha. Anyway there won't be any stuffing inside it and only dough. So i will ask for book today
28/04/22, 4:57 pm - +91 6203 329 502: Zaitoon was way better than this anjappar. food quality, taste etc all were superior
28/04/22, 4:57 pm - +91 89470 69850: Ya, I am sure it will be bad
28/04/22, 4:57 pm - +91 89470 69850: Even the lassi and lemonade is not cold
28/04/22, 4:57 pm - +91 89470 69850: SGR was better
28/04/22, 4:58 pm - +91 80876 92627: this is serious. These should definitely be brought to cmgfs head and CCW chairman 🙈
28/04/22, 4:58 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly
28/04/22, 4:59 pm - +91 79087 55490: This was way back in December
28/04/22, 4:59 pm - +91 89470 69850: Multiple discussions are going on
28/04/22, 4:59 pm - +91 89470 69850: I am discussing about mess
28/04/22, 5:00 pm - +91 89470 69850: About this something need to be done
28/04/22, 5:00 pm - +91 80876 92627: Don't worry. I will pursue it. Will make sure that Neelkesh is replaced by something better.
28/04/22, 5:00 pm - +91 89470 69850: Yes
28/04/22, 5:01 pm - +91 79087 55490: Ask for the book Or else create a ruckus there and then in CCW
28/04/22, 5:01 pm - +91 80876 92627: Yes. Lets please pressurise the caterer by giving more complaint in the book. Else emails.
28/04/22, 5:01 pm - +91 80876 92627: Yes. Needed.
28/04/22, 5:02 pm - +91 94990 48210: good going guys.  keep the pressure on caterer. either they need to improve food quality or go from the campus
28/04/22, 5:15 pm - +91 84393 73413: according to GCC the current infection rate in campus is 0.0257% and you project for 7500+ cases then it'll be around 192 cases. 
If you considering the manipulation of data by authorities then it could be around 0.04% which stand for 7500 samples is 300 cases.
But due to dense population in hostels area it could be around 0.05% to 0.06% infection rate. 
considering the fact that the omicrion infection rate in JAN in densely populated cities was 15-20% avg. 
 So may expect higher no. of cases here
28/04/22, 5:17 pm - +91 83018 85364: I think the restrictions except the mess will be over tomorrow, right?
28/04/22, 5:19 pm - +91 6203 329 502: hostel quarantine is extended up to 2nd may by gcc

28/04/22, 5:29 pm - +91 97002 76503: Unless we get to know things by email it isn't official...by word of mouth if we know things that's unofficial....
28/04/22, 5:30 pm - +91 6203 329 502: warden is no word of mouth... he is in management team of iitm.  it's ok if you are not ready to take his words. wait for dost message then regarding extension
28/04/22, 5:31 pm - +91 70921 52211: Ok , just add (not official) with such messages and it'll be fine I guess.

28/04/22, 5:37 pm - +91 89470 69850: Ok
28/04/22, 5:39 pm - +91 80053 64128: You should have left if it was an emergency. They are very rigid in giving permission. I still remember, one student father died previous year and he had to leave immediately. It was night time, he asked for permission and as usual he was asked he can only get after a process which will take a day or two. Hence depending on your reason make your decision.
28/04/22, 5:39 pm - +91 70921 52211: Bro they aren't even letting people out of gates for 5 mins
28/04/22, 5:41 pm - +91 70921 52211: But ig you could pretend to be a day scholar.
28/04/22, 5:41 pm - Divyanshu: Best option🤟🏻

28/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 70039 50664: Create some general body from all hostels and make some protest, can't take it anymore😒 even i am now thinking to drop out as it is nothing but mental torture to me now
28/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 89470 69850: Do you have any vehicle
28/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 6203 329 502: day scholar
28/04/22, 5:45 pm - +91 89470 69850: No nothing like that
28/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 89470 69850: Gate pass is for vehicles only
28/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 89470 69850: At velachery gate
28/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 6203 329 502: at taramani gate i am talking
28/04/22, 5:46 pm - +91 6203 329 502: drop out? leaving the campus forever?
28/04/22, 5:47 pm - +91 89470 69850: I am nothing saying that we should go out.
Just follow the rules.
For the record
28/04/22, 5:48 pm - +91 78911 25593: There is no water at 5th floor

28/04/22, 5:59 pm - +91 87770 84338: Don't get demotivated 
We are with you.
Have patience.
28/04/22, 5:59 pm - +91 6203 329 502: other hostel whatsapp groups have their warden and ccw official added in their hostel whatsapp group... in our mahandhi group.. no officials not even warden...
28/04/22, 5:59 pm - +91 6203 329 502: i can understand... be strong
28/04/22, 5:59 pm - +91 87633 74318: United student front is the need...
Else this will go for long till gcc wants
28/04/22, 6:01 pm - +91 70039 50664: unite all the hostellers and tell our demands to the iitm authorities if possible else situation will worsen
28/04/22, 6:01 pm - +91 6203 329 502: why gcc is so concerned only for iit madras? they are not imposing these harsh rules outside... not even testing everyone... only harassing students
28/04/22, 6:02 pm - +91 97002 76503: Let us not talk about unity...how many students went to the deans office today for LAN issue...✌🏻
28/04/22, 6:02 pm - +91 97002 76503: Unity is when we are not lazy
28/04/22, 6:03 pm - +91 70921 52211: because iitm authorities messed up when they made offline exams mandatory. And the 3 day isolation wasn't implemented properly.
28/04/22, 6:05 pm - +91 87633 74318: Correct but more people from all hostels needed for a firm stand .
Else this will go on.
28/04/22, 6:05 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly
28/04/22, 6:05 pm - +91 79087 55490: I am always there
28/04/22, 6:05 pm - +91 97002 76503: Not even a single msg today morning saying let's go to deans office for LAN issue after 100s of msgs regarding the same yesterday....this is our unity
28/04/22, 6:06 pm - +91 84393 73413: just one suggestion...if we people want to happened something in our favor then its enough talking in group and now we have to and sit down infront of himalaya and let them know why  all are here.
All mahanadi residents atleast
28/04/22, 6:06 pm - +91 70921 52211: most people's net is working fine, that's why i guess
28/04/22, 6:06 pm - +91 82729 09591: Forget 3 days isolation. The whole 21 Btech batch was called for reporting on one day. We all saw the crowds in front of Mandakini. Everyone was moving as usual. Now we bear the brunt
28/04/22, 6:07 pm - +91 6203 329 502: that 3 day isolation upon arrival was the biggest joke. every body was roaming inside campus and going everywhere even outside...
28/04/22, 6:07 pm - +91 97002 76503: Then what about tomorrow brother....protest is always for a better tomorrow...One day doesn't means future is good...
28/04/22, 6:08 pm - +91 84393 73413: gather at himalaya
28/04/22, 6:08 pm - +91 70921 52211: tbh i haven't had any issue with internet since I came here.

28/04/22, 9:38 pm - +91 99900 38056: Please collect your clothes from RR5 washing machine.

28/04/22, 9:53 pm - +91 95855 71750: There is mcb room near stairs. Some mcb might have tripped. Go and turn it on.
28/04/22, 9:57 pm - +91 95855 71750: If u don't know please don't try. Call someone who knows it. Could be dangerous.
28/04/22, 9:59 pm - +91 80053 64128: Not only dangerous but you might screw someone else room electricity too by mistake.
28/04/22, 10:04 pm - +91 95855 71750: It's better to call the electrician so that he can trace out the problem that caused the tripping. It might be a short circuit. It's advisable to point out the problem before you turn the mcb on again.
28/04/22, 10:13 pm - +91 80876 92627: @919500836353 can you please clarify what is the issue with water can supply floor to floor basis?

28/04/22, 10:51 pm - +91 95603 94281: thanks for the help guys, it is really pathetic we guys are asking to get lifts serviced and no one is taking this issue seriously.
While I was stuck on the other side lift, one of the guy was stucked for more than 30mins in the lift and guards weren't able to help because of this pathetic lifts
28/04/22, 10:52 pm - +91 95603 94281: i urge technical secretary to please make manager and warden get this lifts serviced or repaired ASAP

28/04/22, 10:53 pm - +91 99626 09717: Update on the issue with the lifts:

The security guard was working towards solving the issue. Hence he wasn't at the ground floor. 
When the emergency key didn't help open the door, he called the lift maintenance personnel. 

The maintenance personnel told me (on call) how to reset the lifts. On 4th attempt, we were successfully able to reset the lifts. (The other 3 lifts had gotten reset in the first attempt.)
28/04/22, 10:55 pm - +91 99626 09717: These lifts have been giving issues since at least 2017 now.
I request @919700276503 to talk to the Warden sir and tell him that we need a permanent fix for this issue.
28/04/22, 10:55 pm - +91 99626 09717: If some claustrophobic person gets stuck inside the lifts, it can be quite a distressing experience for them.
28/04/22, 10:56 pm - +91 97002 76503: Sure tomorrow morning i will talk to  warden sir
28/04/22, 10:57 pm - +91 99626 09717: The lift that created issue tonight is the one on our *right*, when we are facing towards the lifts. In the wing that's _not_ near the hostel entrance.
28/04/22, 10:57 pm - +91 97002 76503: Ok
28/04/22, 10:58 pm - +91 97002 76503: Pls help me with the room number beside that lift on the ground floor

28/04/22, 10:59 pm - +91 70921 52211: Yes, both of them keep stopping. Like the outside buttons stop working too.
28/04/22, 10:59 pm - +91 80876 92627: We can term it as front side and back side. Front:  Taking right from the entrance.

29/04/22, 11:00 am - Vivek Ta: 👍. But what about the people who thinks we are under some sort of water scarcity and steel water water cans from other floor.
29/04/22, 11:19 am - +91 94860 87050: Steal ? How ?

Did they take it from your room ? Or Did they take to their room ? 

Water is a common facility. You can ask them to take the can from ground floor.
29/04/22, 11:21 am - +91 88537 00390: +1.. Right bro
29/04/22, 11:23 am - +91 89358 07555: It was before we arrived  in the hostel buddy
29/04/22, 11:24 am - +91 89358 07555: Since*
29/04/22, 11:27 am - +91 78320 19030: Water is not there in 4th floor
29/04/22, 11:29 am - +91 90608 77777: Idk..i didnt see it 2 days back

and there are many more scratches which were not there before
29/04/22, 11:30 am - +91 89358 07555: It seems like new one😒
29/04/22, 11:30 am - +91 89358 07555: Idiots
29/04/22, 11:32 am - +91 74046 59903: They were 2 torn cloth patches on snooker table since we arrived in the hostel. It's not new.
29/04/22, 11:35 am - Vivek Ta: Using a word steal is of concern, than the actual behaviour of the particular student. Is it some sort of diversion from the actual matter. 🤔 And, we can't steel from a public place 🤔
29/04/22, 11:43 am - +91 94860 87050: See, water is a common facility for entire hostel.
29/04/22, 11:45 am - +91 94860 87050: There is nothing wrong in taking it from other floor. That's it.
29/04/22, 11:48 am - +91 70921 52211: Kinda ironic we live in hostels named on rivers🤦‍♂
29/04/22, 11:49 am - +91 84660 59931: River with no water😂
29/04/22, 11:52 am - Vivek Ta: This thought is the main reason that no one wants to take water from the ground floor. Keep it up🤝🤝
29/04/22, 11:56 am - Vivek Ta: Also remember, the water can doesn't magically come to top floor.
29/04/22, 11:58 am - +91 79804 18220: We have already paid to the hostel for water facilities, LAN, electricity and security. 
So don't know why sometimes the LAN issue and majorly water issue remains🙂?
29/04/22, 12:06 pm - +91 83019 58568: ❌❌❌❌I found a ring  near Washing area in the fourth floor....  dm me if you have lost it with the identity of the ring..... ❌❌❌❌❌❌
29/04/22, 12:09 pm - +91 91136 63813: +1. Why negate someone else's efforts when you can just as easily get it from the ground floor?
29/04/22, 12:13 pm - +91 94860 87050: You can ASK them to take it from ground floor. Can't name their as per your convenient like Stealing.
29/04/22, 12:14 pm - +91 70921 52211: +1, it takes equal amount of efforts to bring water can from any floor due to lift.
29/04/22, 12:16 pm - Vivek Ta: Ok. Let me know you floor/wing guys. Same amount of effort, isn't it?. 🙂🙂
29/04/22, 12:18 pm - +91 70921 52211: I'm agreeing with you. People should bring cans from ground floor only
29/04/22, 12:23 pm - Vivek Ta: Thanks 👍. Burden of responsibility on the person who raises the concern. Hereafter, I will keep a watch on my floor's water can continuously and advice them that "EVEN THOUGH IT IS OK TO TAKE CANS FROM OTHER FLOORS", take it from ground floor.

I understand that using steal is bit harsh.
29/04/22, 12:30 pm - +91 97002 76503: Hi guys,
I had a word with the hostel manager regarding the water shortage on the floors.He said that everyday they make sure that there is water on every floor.Yesteday night around 6:30PM also they had kept atleast 4 can for each dispenser. Some students are taking these cans to there rooms and are using personally.This accounts to the water shortage.
I request the students not to take the can in the rooms.
29/04/22, 12:31 pm - +91 97002 76503: Also identifying people who are taking these cans to the room is also next to impossible so at a personal level only we can solve this..
29/04/22, 12:32 pm - +91 95535 34691: People taking water cans to room was an issue when I was in Bhadra. Just don’t understand these people
29/04/22, 1:02 pm - +91 80876 92627: I doubt if that is the case. If he had come up, won't he take empty cans? Yesterday all cans were there only. He didn't come up at all. That guy might be lying.
29/04/22, 1:04 pm - +91 80876 92627: I am not sure. But someone taking all 4 cans at once is unlikely.
29/04/22, 1:23 pm - +91 97002 76503: Might be👍🏻
29/04/22, 1:27 pm - +91 98801 39699: With at least 40 residents on a floor, and each consuming average 3 litres water, 
4 cans won’t last more than half a day.

The problem is they are still bringing water as before this hostel lockdown.
29/04/22, 1:28 pm - +91 98801 39699: We should request them to bring it more frequently since we are spending whole day here
29/04/22, 1:31 pm - +91 97002 76503: 👍🏻
29/04/22, 1:35 pm - +91 95855 71750: I have seen ppl taking water cans to their rooms.
29/04/22, 1:38 pm - +91 89470 69850: Exactly
29/04/22, 1:39 pm - +91 89470 69850: Today on 1st floor there were atlest 8 empty cans
29/04/22, 1:40 pm - +91 89470 69850: Water shortage is there is chennai or what?
29/04/22, 3:17 pm - +91 73473 91551: Anyone facing internet issues?
29/04/22, 3:37 pm - +91 93435 34852: Yes. In Groud floor.

30/04/22, 10:23 pm - +91 96663 62104: We hardly find time on weekends to refresh and that too in the evenings and because of such restrictions (TT room timings restricted to 9.30AM to 9.30 PM because someone complained to warden) we can't even do that now dude.
30/04/22, 10:24 pm - +91 96741 12479: At weekends I think the TV room should be open till late night but the loud music needs to stop!! So if anyone have any problems regarding that please state your problems!! On regular days I guess the time could be restricted to 10PM.

01/05/22, 12:29 am - +91 80770 07626: It's fine till 12 AM but some guys use to play and shout at 2-3 AM and because of that we guys living nearer to the TV room couldn't sleep. When we ask them to not to play/shout late night then they said-"we don't have any official information of closing timing and we will play whenever we want".
So there should be a fixed closing time. 
We should discuss and decide a suitable closing timing.
01/05/22, 12:32 am - +91 90106 45473: +1
01/05/22, 12:33 am - +91 96741 12479: Yeah certainly!! If the noise issue is the problem then that can be solved through discussion!!
01/05/22, 12:36 am - +91 84365 53227: Okay!! Thanks for the info. Please try to make it usable asap!!
01/05/22, 12:52 am - +91 97501 05676: To your concerns,

1. Noise comes when we play TT. So we can have those timings for that game alone.

2. Also whenever we are playing, based on the involvement level, obviously players will try to show their emotions which is reaching your ears as noise. 

3. I suggest you to come once and join us while playing there. Then you will understand what I am saying more clearly. 

4. Finally we are playing only during the weekends in which almost everyone chill. So bear with us during the weekends.
01/05/22, 1:03 am - +91 81458 31742: Environmental Impact Assessment (civil)
Is there anyone present who has this subject in this semester? Or previously it was there for anyone?
Kindly reply here
01/05/22, 1:03 am - +91 81458 31742: Or ping me personally
01/05/22, 1:19 am - +91 80770 07626: I understand your point. But it's open for whole day bro and I am just asking it to be closed atleast during sleeping hours. 
If there wouldn't be any closing time then anyone will come at anytime in night like 3,4 ,5 am according to their schedule and play,shout. And that would disturb the all nearby residing guys.
How would you control that? 

And for your point no. 2,3 : imagine yourself sleeping closed to that room and if someone shows his emotions at 3/4  AM then the voices will prick you as well. 
We can manage and bear it for sometime but not for always.

So I would strongly suggest that there should be a closing time.
01/05/22, 1:21 am - +91 82400 01879: Can anyone tell where is the kitchen room??
01/05/22, 1:27 am - +91 88853 66406: Ground floor.
01/05/22, 1:27 am - +91 88853 66406: Yes.. please suggest in the GBM meeting then we can decide about it.
01/05/22, 1:28 am - +91 97501 05676: Sleeping hours is different for different people dude, you cannot cater to each and everyone's need.

 (Apparently based on your previous messages, this is your sleeping hour i guess, why are you texting here instead of sleeping? 

I am not trying to argue here. If we keep on arguing, this will never end. 

Why are you not understanding the point that we are playing only during weekends??

Right from the start you keep exaggerating things.

 Nobody is playing till 5AM for sure. 

Even if they play, then also you should not have any problem because they are not playing in your room.

 They are playing in the so called common room only which is meant to do that.
01/05/22, 1:30 am - +91 97501 05676: Closing time can be there for weekdays but on weekends it should not be there according to my point of view.
01/05/22, 1:30 am - +91 97501 05676: When it is happening?
01/05/22, 1:32 am - +91 88853 66406: Brothers please be cool.. while playing close the doors. Please make it a pleasant atmosphere with all.
01/05/22, 1:32 am - +91 88853 66406: Probability on Wednesday. Let's see
01/05/22, 1:34 am - +91 80770 07626: Cool, we will discuss it at that time. 👍🏻
01/05/22, 1:35 am - +91 97501 05676: Based on the concerns raised by the nearby room members of the common room, it is clear that some of us while playing there in common room are not keeping the doors closed and also making more noise. 

I request those who are playing in the common room  to try to keep the door closed and also try to reduce the noise while playing.
01/05/22, 1:37 am - +91 97501 05676: You are still online....
It's 1.35AM dude 
🧐
01/05/22, 1:39 am - +91 77080 72829: I think the nature of making your point is quite rude bro. Please make ur point peaceful manner🙏
01/05/22, 1:42 am - +91 80770 07626: Yes I am. And I will. What's your problem? If you can't make a discussion in proper manner then don't. Anyways I don't want to argue with you. We will discuss on Wednesday in GBM.
01/05/22, 1:45 am - +91 97501 05676: Because of the guy who complained (by directly sending a mail to our warden) we couldn't play today after 9.30pm dude, since the guys saying near to that room will sleep during that time and if we play in that time they will get disturbed.
01/05/22, 1:47 am - +91 97501 05676: Here comes a guy who stays near to that common room and staying awake till 1.45AM today.  

That's why even I already mentioned that we cannot cater to each and every one's needs 

We are not doing any wrong thing here. I am reiterating that we are just playing in a dedicated space in our hostel which is kept for that!!
01/05/22, 1:48 am - +91 97501 05676: I don't have any problem dude, just wanted to say goodnight and sweet dreams to you.

GN
SD🙂
01/05/22, 1:48 am - +91 99946 34399: It's not alway sleeping, if a person is doing important work, he will get disturbed
01/05/22, 1:51 am - +91 97501 05676: So according to you, that person will wait from 9.30AM till 9.30 PM whole day to do his important work after that (exactly when we are playing)

Is that what you meant my friend?
01/05/22, 1:51 am - +91 97501 05676: That too on a weekend??
01/05/22, 1:51 am - +91 97501 05676: 🤔🤔
01/05/22, 1:51 am - +91 99946 34399: The point is you are no one to disturb any person while you are playing
01/05/22, 1:51 am - +91 99946 34399: at any time
01/05/22, 1:52 am - +91 97501 05676: Check this message dude...
01/05/22, 1:53 am - +91 99946 34399: You should read it once I guess
01/05/22, 1:53 am - +91 99946 34399: still you were making noise after he requested you all to keep quiet
01/05/22, 1:55 am - Vivek Ta: Was there any instruction from warden/manager regarding the timing of using sports room??
01/05/22, 1:55 am - +91 97501 05676: Pls don't start it again. The reply has been sent for that issue
01/05/22, 1:55 am - +91 99946 34399: you are unnecessary arguing
01/05/22, 1:57 am - +91 97501 05676: Okay bro then let's stop here and discuss in the upcoming GBM about this
01/05/22, 1:57 am - +91 99946 34399: Ya
01/05/22, 1:57 am - +91 94860 87050: Sending mail to warden is not a crime bro. Anyway this things can be discussed in GBM. 

But at the same time (even restrictions imposed about timing by warden) you played today till 11 PM. Is it correct that playing outdoor game like cricket in common corridors outside Common Room ? 

It's a kind of provoking him after he complained. It's a not thing according to me. 

Atleast all indoor games (Common Room) needs to put timing (by considering common time of all, preferably 6 AM to 10 PM). Anyway all things related to timing can be discussed in GBM and make a final call.
01/05/22, 1:57 am - +91 94860 87050: 👍
01/05/22, 2:25 am - +91 99780 73246: Insti's preferable sleeping hours are 10pm to 5am, all the facilities timings are decided basis on that including mess,gym,swimming, vatsa etc...  due to any facility other then academic bothers or disturbs others then it should be closed during this time whether on regular day or some other day. And before joining hostel every students sign three online form, so all are bound to follow that.
01/05/22, 2:26 am - +91 99780 73246: So no point in open room for late hours
01/05/22, 2:27 am - +91 99780 73246: ~room~ TV room
01/05/22, 2:52 am - +91 85100 64198: @Secretaries

I discussed the needs of some students who workout in the common room. Others can add to it:

1. Please fix a full size mirror for the gym partition in the common room.

2. The gym bench kept is in a dire condition. It is severely rusted and moves a lot while working out which increases the possibility of injuries. Please purchase a nice, heavy and sturdy bench as it is a one time investment and would help in avoiding mishaps. You can take help of some people who workout regularly while ordering.

3. Installation of a pull up bar is also requested.

4. All dumbells cannot be used as some are missing the rings required to fix weights. This makes them unusable.

5. As the weight plates were kept in a dumpyard for a long time during COVID, they have a lot of solid grease and dust stuck on it. A thorough cleaning of the plates would be really helpful as it would maintain hygeine.

6. The common room needs a planned rearrangement as it is difficult for people to play with any of the facilities available. People are always running into walls/each other while playing/lifting as playing tables have been kept awkwardly (there is also a big wooden table with no purpose kept in one corner of the room).

7. As the weather is set to get worse, opening windows doesn't provide enough ventilation, especially during peak hours. While installing ACs might not be feasible economically, installation of multiple exhaust fans would be helpful to avoid the humidity.

I don't know the budget allocation but if there is enough, it would be better to replace the dumbells and barbells as they're way past their lifetime.
01/05/22, 8:24 am - +91 90106 45473: Yes exactly we cannot cater each and everyone's needs. We cannot cater your needs just because you play/don't play silently. 
Everyday we cannot go say people to be quiet.
Some mahaan aadmi starts playing songs with strong  sound and 1 in the night.🤷🏻‍♂️
Yes. Everyone does have their own sleep routine but since some guys play songs and other times we don't complaint if it is scheduled time before 9 30(even when writing end sem or having meeting). This is actually called catering to your needs. 
Research scholars work is not 9-5. Sometimes deadlines pileup. 
I am sure being a scholar you would know that.
01/05/22, 8:36 am - +91 97917 89205: It is our kind request pls do not play indoor sports between 10.30 to 5.00.
01/05/22, 8:42 am - +91 84394 30391: +1
01/05/22, 8:49 am - +91 82400 01879: There is no drinking water in   our floor no 5
01/05/22, 8:50 am - +91 84394 30391: Back in pre covid days we had subscription of netflix , amazon prime and hotstar . This should be renewed now
01/05/22, 9:21 am - +91 70921 52211: That's none of your business, and it definitely doesn't give you the right to be a douche bag.  Especially when you're the one disturbing other people's sleep.
01/05/22, 9:21 am - +91 70921 52211: Just because someone else is being an ass doesn't mean you should too, very weak argument my man.

01/05/22, 10:15 am - +91 96663 62104: The point is no one should interfere in any other persons work. For the the guy who complained, sleep is important may be for him and for  some guys their recreational time will be of utmost importance in between the hectic schedules they have. Anyway not even a single ant enters that room in the day timings and as we all of them are research scholars we find time only after sunset. We are not asking to open that room for weekdays but atleast for weekends.
01/05/22, 10:26 am - +91 70921 52211: The point is, people should calm their TTs. (Pun intended)

01/05/22, 7:36 pm - +91 94860 87050: At the same time, requesting everyone not to opt this unless you have any other important meeting.

1. Manager can't keep this for everyone as he may other works.
2. Samosa may get spoil as time goes. So it will be good if you collect it early to avoid this.

As the summer is in full swing, I think many residents need this facility like me. So kindly check the matter and do a thorough servicing.

02/05/22, 11:12 pm - +91 88855 00157: They charge around 400 bucks for washing and ironing ...the rate depends on the weight of the clothes

03/05/22, 11:29 pm - +91 97002 76503: Cool water is available in the water filter near the gate ...if it's not working i will get it fixed soon just mention it in the complain book 👍🏻
04/05/22, 9:10 am - +91 96236 44088: Which floor has working semi-automatic washing machine?
04/05/22, 9:25 am - +91 79804 18220: 3rd floor
04/05/22, 9:50 am - +91 87633 74318: Actually more semi automatic machines are fit for hostel usage .

Since it can manage the rough handling
04/05/22, 9:50 am - +91 87633 74318: Even it is slightly inconvenient
04/05/22, 9:56 am - +91 99780 73246: 3th floor semi automatic machine is not working properly.... water is not coming out properly and all the regulators or controls are not broken or not fitted well... also it is outdated machine... can we buy new semiautomatic washing machine for the 4th floor???
04/05/22, 9:56 am - +91 99780 73246: If not posaible can you fix it asap??
04/05/22, 9:57 am - +91 99780 73246: @918885366406
04/05/22, 10:02 am - +91 97002 76503: Post GBM we will buy... regarding the maintenance it will be done once a month..please enter your complain in the complain book
04/05/22, 10:04 am - +91 97002 76503: Can u confirm whether both the motor spin and the wash are in working condition??
04/05/22, 10:06 am - +91 97002 76503: By the end of this month we will buy two new washing machines and also 2 machines can be repaired which are lying idle in the store.....
04/05/22, 10:07 am - +91 87633 74318: I understand 
Actually prior i was in tapti and most of the machines were semi automatic

It uses less water and washing actually gets over by 30 mins 

It can handle rough use of people who are unfamiliar with washing machine

Only drawback is that it is not automatic so person needs to monitor. 

The drawback of automatic is that sometimes it takes water to fill so some people  fill the water with bucket which spoils the sensors.
04/05/22, 10:07 am - +91 97002 76503: +1
04/05/22, 10:08 am - +91 80876 92627: Opinion may vary person to person. Many of them will prefer automatic machines. Semi automatic are more prone to damage when u load more and heavy clothes in dryer.
04/05/22, 10:08 am - +91 97002 76503: That's why we can discuss this in GBM
04/05/22, 10:09 am - +91 97002 76503: Pls attend the GBM today
04/05/22, 10:09 am - +91 80876 92627: Keeping the balance is necessary. One semi automatic and one automatic would be good.
04/05/22, 10:09 am - +91 80876 92627: 👍
04/05/22, 10:09 am - +91 87633 74318: Yup this happened there but still washing machine worked .
It's better than washing in bucket
04/05/22, 10:09 am - +91 97002 76503: This is also true
04/05/22, 10:10 am - +91 80876 92627: I have also seen people leaving the tap on in semi automatic for around half hour and forgetting that they have to wash clothes 🤣
04/05/22, 10:11 am - +91 99693 94156: Kindly keep the GBM after 6pm or something, 5pm most PPL would be in labs.
04/05/22, 10:12 am - +91 87633 74318: Hmm let's see anyways things will happen as per what majority want ....
04/05/22, 10:12 am - +91 80876 92627: But my request is that don't decide majority based on the people attending GBM. For such decisions, Google forms should be circulated
04/05/22, 10:15 am - +91 97002 76503: Post GBM we can circulate one form...But thing is people don't fill the form...they donot have that much time or interest....hardly we get some response...that's the hard truth...
04/05/22, 10:19 am - +91 80876 92627: @918885366406 kindly think on this if possible. If many are available after 6 it would be good.

04/05/22, 12:22 pm - +91 88853 66406: Already circulated to all along with warden sir as well so try to join and give ur suggestions. Tq brother
04/05/22, 12:53 pm - Vivek Ta: Need to keep the objective of this group clear and explicit. Until then, we can't tell some convo is important and some are irrelevent. 

The discussions in this group will surely get buried in a matter of time. That cannot be avoided even if the messages are strictly regulated.
04/05/22, 12:57 pm - Vivek Ta: Students are not recording their complaints in the hostel complaints register and posting their issues directly here for quick resolution. That shoul be first discouraged. If some issue is happening such as electrical, network, monkeys, watercans etc., then it means someone is not doing their job correctly. Using a shortcut way(reporting) may solve the problem temporarily and the actual root cause may left unattended.
04/05/22, 12:58 pm - +91 97002 76503: Strongly agree👍🏻👍🏻
04/05/22, 1:08 pm - +91 88853 66406: Then shall we delete this group?
04/05/22, 1:09 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yes. Correct brother
04/05/22, 1:36 pm - +91 95603 94281: Just an opinion, instead of terming it as 'shortcut' why can't we make complaint system online also. 
@Secretaries can make an effort and talk to the warden regarding this.
04/05/22, 1:40 pm - +91 96742 12703: No need to delete this group. Make this group informal and  for announcements.
04/05/22, 1:49 pm - +91 96741 12479: Why make things complicated!!
04/05/22, 1:53 pm - Vivek Ta: This can be a group for communication between students(like washing machine clothes), communication between student and student secretary. Keeping it formal/official or deleting the group is up to decision of the group admin.
04/05/22, 1:57 pm - Vivek Ta: Until a clear decision is made regarding the purpose of this group, marking some comments as irrelevant even by student secretaries will be harsh and seen as arbitrary.

04/05/22, 7:10 pm - +91 97167 56927: I am not agree...
04/05/22, 7:11 pm - +91 88537 00390: So my point is that... At least should be one team.. Like on secretary and rest one  person from floor
04/05/22, 7:12 pm - +91 88537 00390: Each floor...
04/05/22, 7:14 pm - +91 88853 66406: Not manager by warden sir

04/05/22, 7:19 pm - +91 97167 56927: I am sure most of the students of Mahanadi Hostel would not know who is the warden of our hostel?
04/05/22, 7:20 pm - +91 94860 87050: Regarding that, rubber band issue, I raised it with vendor. He said that it's mistaken. Sorry. From next time, he will correct it.
04/05/22, 7:20 pm - +91 94860 87050: Preferably, from next time, we can go with A2B / Sri Krishna / Nandhini Sweets with one item for one festival. This time as we are near semester end, we didn't have much festivals. That's why 3 items planned.
04/05/22, 7:21 pm - +91 88853 66406: That is our fault not his fault na

06/05/22, 9:37 am - +91 84394 30391: No water in washrooms across multiple floors,
Any such cut in water supply should be communicated beforehand.
And i dont see any explanation from hostel  management.
Atleast inform us when the supply will be restored

06/05/22, 10:48 am - +91 70921 52211: Is someone going to do something about it? If you can't fix it immediately just turn it off. We can't call the other lift because of it😑

06/05/22, 12:05 pm - +91 90597 17081: I have talked to hostel manager.
Tommorow 10 AM - 2 PM all tanks are going to be cleaned.
So please make sure for that time.
For urgent purposes please collect some water in your respective buckets before 10 AM Tommorow.
06/05/22, 12:06 pm - +91 70921 52211: Pin this
06/05/22, 12:12 pm - +91 84393 73413: Dear sir,
Why this cleaning thing  happened just after getting complaints every time. Why there is no such routine cleaning. Before mahanadi, I was in tapti hostel, and there used to be the same issue almost every 4th or 5th day, the dirty water. They just cleaned the tank but never looked to into source.
I would suggest you to look over the water source  and ofcourse  the hostel  tanks
06/05/22, 12:29 pm - +91 90597 17081: Sure, I will examine Tommorow.
06/05/22, 12:34 pm - +91 80876 92627: @918885366406 the water can delivery to the floor as become an issue. Can you please inform exactly what is the problem with vendor?
06/05/22, 12:54 pm - +91 88853 66406: Now, the issue is clear.
06/05/22, 12:54 pm - +91 88853 66406: What happened brother
06/05/22, 12:55 pm - +91 88853 66406: Sure. I will inform above this with manager.
06/05/22, 1:08 pm - +91 80876 92627: The cans are not delivered on the floors. Shortage has increased. If cans are less then more cans has to be managed. Because this is summer time consumption will be more.
06/05/22, 3:25 pm - +91 82400 01879: No lan connection in my room
06/05/22, 3:25 pm - +91 82400 01879: Anyone facing lan issues in 5th floor
06/05/22, 3:25 pm - +91 82400 01879: ?
06/05/22, 4:49 pm - +91 90608 77777: Does anyone have all episodes of silicon valley tv series ?
06/05/22, 4:51 pm - +91 80053 64128: Go to torrent->Search for Silicon Valley episode which you want to see-> Copy the magnet link to Seedr or anyother torrent downloading site-> download from that site.
06/05/22, 4:52 pm - +91 90608 77777: Is it downloadable from iitmwifi ?
06/05/22, 4:53 pm - +91 80053 64128: Torrent cannot be downloaded directly, hence asked you to copy the magnet link to seedr or other sites like that which will download it for you and you can download it from that site.
06/05/22, 5:25 pm - +91 82400 01879: Can anyone tell if there is current is library
06/05/22, 5:33 pm - +91 91567 16710: when will electricity come? any1 knows?

06/05/22, 5:35 pm - +91 88853 66406: Don't send unnecessary msgs brother.
06/05/22, 5:38 pm - +91 88853 66406: If anyone sends waste msgs in the group, the main matter is not pointing to us. So please don't send brother..
06/05/22, 5:42 pm - Kunal Rane: Water cans are not available at 4th and fifth floor from past 5 hours
06/05/22, 5:42 pm - Kunal Rane: Pls look into the matter ASAP

06/05/22, 5:49 pm - +91 90608 77777: The reason I was telling to create another group just for announcements
06/05/22, 6:19 pm - +91 70921 52211: Does anyone have an extra ticket? My investor cannot pay.
06/05/22, 6:19 pm - +91 98608 52494: 😂😂
06/05/22, 6:22 pm - +91 90608 77777: Thats a nice one

06/05/22, 7:31 pm - +91 70921 52211: Not like they respond to problems anyways🥱
06/05/22, 7:34 pm - +91 70921 52211: This is the third time I'm telling this, the left lift needs to be fixed or turned off. It can't be just kept open without a fix. 
I was just stuck in it.
06/05/22, 8:16 pm - +91 88537 00390: The main problem no one listen here....
06/05/22, 8:17 pm - +91 88537 00390: Only option left.. Go to high authorities
06/05/22, 8:55 pm - +91 87633 74318: The fish photo shd be posted in mail to higher authorities
06/05/22, 9:06 pm - +91 91567 16710: true. most of us gargle with that water only after brushing teeths🤷🏻‍♂️
06/05/22, 9:13 pm - +91 88853 66406: How many groups are needed for this? Create a new group for this msgs
06/05/22, 9:15 pm - +91 88853 66406: Brother, already informed him about that issue due to the new vendor, it is taking time. It will resolve brother
06/05/22, 9:17 pm - +91 88853 66406: Brother, if it'll be repeated again then we'll do like that. Now, they r cleaning tanks, tomorrow
06/05/22, 9:19 pm - +91 88853 66406: We mentioned it already. Give them some time to repair it. Tq
06/05/22, 9:42 pm - +91 80876 92627: *Please make announcement 1 hr prior to the tank cleaning*  @918885366406 @919700276503 @919500836353

06/05/22, 9:50 pm - +91 99867 15449 left
06/05/22, 11:38 pm - +91 90608 77777: Most of the necessary messages gets lost amidst other unnecessary messages. Atleast for the announcements or messages from students like getting the clothes out of washing machine or about any lost/found things, there should be a separate group.
06/05/22, 11:52 pm - +91 88537 00390: +1
07/05/22, 2:05 am - +91 88853 66406: Yes bcz those types of unnecessary msgs brother. Did u agree?

07/05/22, 8:51 am - +91 70921 52211: You could've just said 2 PM, instead you sent two messages with no information in it. Bitching about unnecessary messages is also unnecessary. QED
07/05/22, 9:11 am - +91 85418 58847: This message was deleted
07/05/22, 9:12 am - +91 85418 58847: If the tank cleaning is scheduled from 10 AM, then I think I shouldn’t be using the washing machine now?
07/05/22, 9:45 am - +91 88853 66406: Ok. We'll send pin point msgs. Can you(all)?
07/05/22, 10:01 am - +91 90608 77777: It wont happen bro. No one will do it deliberately. Even if someone does so, admins can take care of it.
07/05/22, 10:03 am - +91 70921 52211: We can, anyone can. Whether we choose to or not is a different question. But in any case, it just isn't a good excuse.
07/05/22, 10:21 am - +91 88853 66406: Then good.  let's see.
07/05/22, 12:21 pm - +91 88843 14139: When water supply will start ?

07/05/22, 12:28 pm - +91 88855 00157: Are any floors getting tap water at the washbasins?
07/05/22, 12:28 pm - +91 88855 00157: The water is not coming in the 3rd floor washrooms
07/05/22, 12:29 pm - +91 88843 14139: It is also not coming at 5th floor
07/05/22, 12:29 pm - +91 88855 00157: Ohh kk
07/05/22, 12:30 pm - Vivek Ta: There is a maintenance work going now. 10:00AM to 2:00PM
07/05/22, 12:30 pm - +91 88855 00157: Ohh kk
07/05/22, 12:30 pm - +91 88855 00157: So no water until then?
07/05/22, 12:31 pm - Vivek Ta: Yes even after that can't use for few minutes. You will get dirty water. Beware using washing machines
07/05/22, 12:32 pm - +91 88855 00157: 🙃
07/05/22, 12:32 pm - Vivek Ta: Remove the inlet pipe drain some water then connect it to the washing machine

07/05/22, 2:30 pm - +91 82400 01879: Can you please tell whom to contact for lan issues all the numbers provided at the gate don't work no one has ever picked up phone
07/05/22, 2:35 pm - +91 83018 85364: helpdesknetworks@iitm.ac.in
07/05/22, 2:46 pm - +91 80876 92627: Someone left shower open when tank was being cleaned and when water came it got wasted.
07/05/22, 2:46 pm - +91 80876 92627: Please take care of these small things
07/05/22, 2:49 pm - +91 89198 66167: Please refill water cans in 5th floor. This is happening repeatedly. The water consumption would be high given the weather. Please ensure that adequate steps are taken to have the water cans refilled periodically
07/05/22, 2:51 pm - +91 81458 31742: I checked that in ground floor lots of can are present ...but in floor nothing is there.
I told that to manager, he told it'll be there soon
07/05/22, 2:51 pm - +91 81458 31742: But after 1 hour passes still nothing happens
07/05/22, 2:52 pm - Kunal Rane: Does manager has any powers in our hostel?
I don't think so
07/05/22, 2:52 pm - +91 81458 31742: Either it's fault of manager, he didn't force to vendors to kept it in every floor.
Or the vendors are intentionally doing this
07/05/22, 2:54 pm - Kunal Rane: Same problem was mentioned yesterday also
07/05/22, 3:38 pm - +91 89198 66167: As this has been an issue we're facing repeatedly, next time it repeats, it would be a mail to the ccw instead of a message in this group
07/05/22, 6:05 pm - +91 88853 66406: 8050
07/05/22, 10:47 pm - +91 97002 76503: It's Saturday...that might be the reason

08/05/22, 9:15 am - +91 90597 17081: Yes, I will request CCW to Fogg once again. I will also request for spraying nearby washing machines and toilets.
08/05/22, 9:16 am - +91 88853 66406: Fogging is not a solution. We have to do better than that.
08/05/22, 9:23 am - +91 84313 34677: Atleast we can start with fogging instead of waiting for a better option
08/05/22, 9:25 am - +91 88853 66406: Ok
08/05/22, 9:39 am - +91 80746 21056: Whoever left clothes in rr16, collect them from my bucket nearby asap

FYI no complaint register available at security today, so posting here.

08/05/22, 12:48 pm - +91 88224 11339: Please fix the issue, tomorrow is my end sem
08/05/22, 12:48 pm - +91 70921 52211: Why not? Why can we write complaints only during 9-5?
08/05/22, 12:51 pm - +91 97002 76503: Offical document...must be written in front of official staff to register official complaint...I don't know the exact reason maybe but rule is a rule. ..I didn't create the rule so i cannot give the reason...if u want to change it go ahead and pass a resolution 👍🏻
08/05/22, 1:01 pm - Vivek Ta: What is the alternative for this.? What if we have any complaint during weekends?? This response is not expected from you as a secretary. It is kind of isolating yourself from the issue. The request was just to record the issue.
08/05/22, 1:02 pm - +91 97002 76503: Nothing cannot be done because we are here to execute the rules not to create new ones....
08/05/22, 1:04 pm - +91 97002 76503: Hope u know how to make a change ....We only represent u guys...it's not that u give a complain on WhatsApp and with this i go and make them do there duty on a Sunday...There is a protocal everyone needs to follow...u and me together 👍🏻
08/05/22, 1:06 pm - +91 70921 52211: Nothing cannot be done? So everything can be done?
08/05/22, 1:07 pm - +91 70921 52211: Sounds like excuses government gives, IT'S JUST THE LAW
08/05/22, 1:08 pm - Vivek Ta: This reply if received for the first message, then I would not have messaged.
08/05/22, 1:10 pm - +91 97002 76503: 😆😆
08/05/22, 1:11 pm - +91 97002 76503: I hope u would understand that we are just representative we donot have any sort of superpowers that we can surpass the system rules and regulations....
08/05/22, 1:13 pm - Vivek Ta: Anyone reading your reply will understand that,
1) Student council-hostel has no role in creating rules/standards for students.
2) We have to follow protocols. Protocols will started with an official complaint and such complaint can be done only during office hours of hostel.
08/05/22, 1:14 pm - +91 97002 76503: Everyone knows who has created these rules...we u and me only has created these rules...So let's follow it!
08/05/22, 1:14 pm - Vivek Ta: Writing a prompt reply at the first instant does need any super power is my thought.
08/05/22, 1:16 pm - +91 84393 73413: bhai...its not like that🤣
08/05/22, 1:17 pm - Vivek Ta: I don't think students decided to keep the complaint register inside during non-office hours.
08/05/22, 1:17 pm - +91 91664 61895: Can Some body help me  for internet issue in 2nd floor
08/05/22, 1:17 pm - +91 97002 76503: Yes similarly ... complaining on WhatsApp and expecting resolution is also a nightmare 😆
08/05/22, 1:17 pm - +91 88594 08799: @919166461895
08/05/22, 1:17 pm - +91 97002 76503: Don't think ask na..ask the manager...
08/05/22, 1:18 pm - +91 95603 94281: I raised this issue for online complaint earlier also, some of the secretary replied letz not make this complex.
What I suggest is we can create a Google form as a complaint form and the sheet can have access to the 'Officials' like Warden,Manager,etc, this can make the process transparent and fast but more importantly the officials will be responsible for any negligence from their duty.
08/05/22, 1:20 pm - +91 97002 76503: Best will be let's make a toll-free number....what u guys say...it will give 24/7 support
08/05/22, 1:20 pm - +91 77080 72829: 3rd floor
08/05/22, 1:20 pm - +91 95603 94281: I just wanted to have a solution, if you can't take up a healthy conversation. Then no use
08/05/22, 1:21 pm - Vivek Ta: I always think that if we don't have anything to add to the ongoing conversation we should stop conversing. Thanks for taking back to square one.
08/05/22, 1:21 pm - +91 97002 76503: 👍🏻
08/05/22, 1:22 pm - +91 77080 72829: Yeah. No internet in room 422
08/05/22, 1:22 pm - +91 80876 92627: Approach Warden with this suggestion
08/05/22, 1:22 pm - +91 97002 76503: Solution is give by a process buddy not here in WhatsApp...write an email to people who can change it through proper channel....
08/05/22, 1:23 pm - +91 70921 52211: +1. the current situation just seems like escapism at best.
08/05/22, 1:23 pm - +91 70921 52211: nothing wrong in discussing it beforehand
08/05/22, 1:23 pm - +91 97002 76503: Appreciate your compliments but I will execute things which are official that's my duty...
08/05/22, 1:24 pm - +91 95603 94281: yeah, will do it tomorrow, no use of discussing to this secretaries
08/05/22, 1:24 pm - +91 70921 52211: No, it wasn't targeted at you. I'm just dissing the system.
08/05/22, 1:25 pm - +91 97002 76503: Problem is we only discuss we don't take it forward... discussing here and keeping quite expecting secretary will  followup doesn't work...let's work together and make a change...👍🏻
08/05/22, 1:26 pm - +91 95603 94281: Yeah we tried discussing
08/05/22, 1:26 pm - +91 95603 94281: This message was deleted
08/05/22, 1:27 pm - +91 95603 94281: here is your solution
08/05/22, 1:27 pm - +91 70921 52211: well, but you have got to represent us right? if something comes from you, it would obviously sound more credible.
08/05/22, 1:27 pm - +91 97002 76503: See it's is an option as u gave an option i too gave a option...
08/05/22, 1:27 pm - +91 97002 76503: Solution in this group is impossible we don't have powers ...
08/05/22, 1:28 pm - +91 95603 94281: you don't need powers bro, you are a student representative only
08/05/22, 1:28 pm - +91 97002 76503: Always infront of you just call me anytime...but if u say that I am accountable for what's happening then i am not...
08/05/22, 1:29 pm - +91 95603 94281: If you are doing want something good for hostel , we all are with you only. they have to listen to us
08/05/22, 1:30 pm - +91 97002 76503: See I just guided here what's the process for raising a complain if u guys donot like the process then let's revolt but not in this WhatsApp group...no one is here to hear us
08/05/22, 1:31 pm - +91 97002 76503: M just saying i can also give a opinion as u gave ...
08/05/22, 1:31 pm - +91 70921 52211: It's not as black and white. And I'm not saying it specifically to you. But being a secretary is having a position of "responsibility". Ofc you can't be held accountable for everything, but you do have your fair share of responsibility.
08/05/22, 1:33 pm - +91 97002 76503: Sure then hold accountable for things written in complain book and not has been executed... i will give my share of explanation and accountability...in WhatsApp world nothing works...just ppl come and talk...then sleep...
08/05/22, 1:34 pm - Vivek Ta: I m stoping my discussion here. I have taken the screenshot of this. It will be useful when you advice/mark some convos as irrelevent.

PS: That was not my complaint anyway. I was drawn in to this conversation by seeing your response.

Thanks for showing your interest in students issue.
08/05/22, 1:36 pm - +91 70921 52211: I would like to stop the discussion as well. We're clearly going in circles. And as you pointed out this particular conversation isn't leading anywhere, Imma go back to sleep real quick.

18/05/22, 1:01 pm - +91 70039 54884: If those filters are not changed no point fixing the washing machine,  whenever you put clothes to wash , the dirt from the previous wash sticks to the clothes

18/05/22, 1:04 pm - +91 90608 77777: Those filters are meant to be cleaned frequently..I cleaned it 3rd time today since the machine has started working while nobody else does that at RR5..

That is another reason why the water is clogging frequently near wash basins
18/05/22, 1:05 pm - +91 70039 54884: Yes but in RR17 those filters are so damaged that cleaning won't help. Once a new filter comes, we can do a regular cleaning

Humble request to whoever is using: This much quantity is not good for anyone as it directly is depositing inside your lungs through nose so kindly don't do use it especially near windows.

19/05/22, 2:26 pm - +91 70921 52211: Are we even allowed to?
19/05/22, 2:30 pm - +91 74068 08064: I'm not responsible.for that

19/05/22, 2:46 pm - +91 70921 52211: Honestly, that's not my job and I ain't a snitch. People should just have a common decency to not do such things.

20/05/22, 10:19 am - +91 89849 35693: Any mosquito is harmful😂
20/05/22, 10:20 am - +91 94461 56991: It may or may not be infected by dengue virus. But that species can be a vector for spreading dengue.

20/05/22, 5:08 pm - +91 70921 52211: Why is the terrace locked?  Can it be opened?

20/05/22, 5:11 pm - +91 89470 69850: Why do you want it to be open?
20/05/22, 5:13 pm - +91 70921 52211: Fresh air, natural light, view.
20/05/22, 5:13 pm - +91 89470 69850: 👍
20/05/22, 5:22 pm - +91 79047 57768: Monkeys will come from top to bottom😅
20/05/22, 5:22 pm - +91 79047 57768: 😁
20/05/22, 5:23 pm - +91 70921 52211: We can keep the key with the guards like common rooms right?
20/05/22, 5:56 pm - +91 79047 57768: That we can do.....
20/05/22, 6:03 pm - +91 89358 07555: Going to terrace is not allowed in the campus
20/05/22, 6:15 pm - +91 70921 52211: Ok but why?
20/05/22, 6:17 pm - +91 85418 58847: Very probably to prevent suicides
20/05/22, 6:21 pm - +91 70921 52211: That's like applying bandage to a wound bigger than the bandage.
20/05/22, 6:22 pm - +91 70921 52211: There are a ton of studies showing mental health benefits of watching sunrise and sunset.
20/05/22, 6:23 pm - +91 99693 94156: Its still better than removing fans from rooms like IISc!
20/05/22, 6:27 pm - +91 70921 52211: Better than worse doesn't necessarily make it good.
20/05/22, 6:43 pm - +91 73583 31542: 💯
20/05/22, 6:50 pm - +91 80053 64128: Does iisc hostels don't have fans 😳
20/05/22, 6:50 pm - +91 80053 64128: *Do
20/05/22, 6:52 pm - +91 84393 73413: they've replaced with wall fan
20/05/22, 6:52 pm - +91 80053 64128: Cool😅
20/05/22, 6:53 pm - +91 84393 73413: +1
20/05/22, 7:29 pm - +91 85418 58847: Honestly, it is. But it is easier than the other option of providing mental health services
20/05/22, 7:31 pm - +91 88853 66406: No
20/05/22, 7:35 pm - +91 70921 52211: And that's a problem right? Easier solutions often create more problems rather than solving the existing ones. 
Why not solve a problem from its root cause rather than applying unnecessary restrictions? 
Lack of freedom can also increase hopelessness.
20/05/22, 7:41 pm - +91 85418 58847: It is a problem, yes. But that’s how the system works. The unfortunate thing is that the system rewards results and not the efforts.

For example, look at the problem of alcohol. In my own state, Bihar, they have banned alcohol. That was much easier than going through the process of providing de-addiction and rehabilitation services. Also, going through the process would give delayed results, but they needed quick results, and so banned alcohol entirely.
20/05/22, 7:44 pm - +91 70921 52211: Banning substances increases its use(abuse) if anything. 
The numbers might go down because of lack of regulations, (if I bootleg I'll make sure the government doesn't know) but the actual abuse definitely doesn't budge.  
Results are dependent on the test too.
20/05/22, 7:45 pm - +91 70921 52211: Also, I'm not saying it is right to open the terrace while neglecting the suicide issue. If it even saves one life it is definitely worth it. But does it?
20/05/22, 8:10 pm - +91 85418 58847: It very probably doesn’t. Those who are suicidal will not become well just because the terrace is locked. Those who are well will not become suicidal just because the terrace is open. Suicidal people will find other ways
20/05/22, 8:14 pm - +91 70921 52211: Nicely put.

20/05/22, 9:30 pm - +91 89358 07555: Don't be childish any more.....deep down you already know that administration and ccw won't allow any such terrace option for roam or any other activity....so focus on different things that will be better

" If you're not controversial you're a hypocrite "
20/05/22, 9:39 pm - +91 85418 58847: Controversial opinions make people uncomfortable. You will see many who are uncomfortable at the thought of discussing mental health, let alone do something about it

20/05/22, 10:06 pm - +91 70921 52211: I'm sorry for not being a sheep. I'm also sorry that people don't take a stand for themselves. I'm sorry that these sheeps try to silence people actually thinking about the problem. 
I'm sorry this strawman is the only thing you can contribute with.

21/05/22, 4:06 pm - +91 80036 24945: This is basic facility not advance facility. Why several students bodies appoint in hostel if they fail to provide basic facility.
21/05/22, 4:59 pm - +91 89470 69850: Well the poster in the hostel entrance looks cool.
21/05/22, 5:04 pm - +91 70251 40314: The not working fridge is also gives a great impression..
21/05/22, 5:07 pm - +91 89470 69850: Ya and what about the water cooler behind the fridge

21/05/22, 5:13 pm - +91 97002 76503: Water cooler is working
21/05/22, 5:13 pm - +91 70251 40314: Okay.....

21/05/22, 5:14 pm - +91 70251 40314: Why are we waiting to get all the things repaired? Other hostels are buying new washing machines and all...and here we are repairing things..
21/05/22, 5:15 pm - +91 70251 40314: Like the semi automatic one in 4th floor, the water filling is so slow..we take water in bucket and fill it..
21/05/22, 5:15 pm - +91 70251 40314: And after a repair, these machines are giving another complaint again after a week or so...
21/05/22, 5:16 pm - +91 97002 76503: Washing machines will be purchased on 21st moreover we have repaire 3 washing machines and two more semi automatic will be repaired on Monday.....idea is to utilise the old ones and reduce e waste... however we will purchase two machines late this month...

24/05/22, 1:05 pm - +91 97002 76503: Hi guys,
         As you are aware that our air compressor is not working. We tried to repair it but the repair cost is a lot around 5k, However the new compressor costs around 4times the repair cost.Should we buy a new one or repair.In my budget this can be accommodated at the cost of the automatic washing machine.As told in GBM we are going to purchase two washing machine... but as of now I have repaired around 4 machines which were supposed to be condemned...

Any suggestions...!!
24/05/22, 1:06 pm - +91 97002 76503: And i have also placed order for 2 semi automatic washing machine heavy load 7.5kgs...
24/05/22, 1:06 pm - +91 97002 76503: We will get it in this week
24/05/22, 1:11 pm - +91 80053 64128: Please get few new washing machine preferably *semi automatic*. It's so hard to find a proper washing machine here. Some which are working are adding additional black or brown colour small things in the clothes after washing. Please look into it. It's my sincere request to you all.
24/05/22, 1:12 pm - +91 80053 64128: Thank you!
24/05/22, 1:13 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly
24/05/22, 1:14 pm - +91 97002 76503: Already ordered today we will get two new machines this week and also we repaired 4 machines ... don't worry things will be sorted this weekend
24/05/22, 1:14 pm - Vivek Ta: I have question regarding this. This compressor was working fine (as per my knowledge) before initial CoViD lockdown. It was shifted to some other location because this hostel was handed over to Chennai corporation. Compare with other hostels where such equipment were up and running didnt need much maintenance cost. Now, we are spending most part of the budget in replenishing/refurbishing these equipment. We have less scope to expand the facilities. (As we are almost starting from zero again). So are these spendings fair and justifiable.?
24/05/22, 1:15 pm - Vivek Ta: Mainly pump, washing machines.
24/05/22, 1:16 pm - +91 97002 76503: Brother it's is fair or not i can say you that it's unfair..but whome to blame is the question....fridge air compressor and washing machine all got problems because they were not use during lockdown....
24/05/22, 1:17 pm - +91 97002 76503: But as a tech sec with the given limited budget to me what i can offer is the thing i am asking...
24/05/22, 1:17 pm - +91 90608 77777: Whatever new equipments we are bringing, it is added into students' establishment charges..Isnt it ?
24/05/22, 1:18 pm - +91 97002 76503: I am not clear about it may be yes...
24/05/22, 1:20 pm - +91 97002 76503: Let's discuss that buying a new one is good or to get it repaired....
24/05/22, 1:21 pm - +91 90608 77777: i think its not needed immediately since we can use it at pampa hostel whenever needed
24/05/22, 1:24 pm - +91 89470 69850: Is it?
24/05/22, 1:24 pm - Vivek Ta: I m not blaming anyone here. Mahanadhi hostel is at disadvantage at many fronts due to its usage as isolation centre by outsiders. So it will be only right, if the hostel is handed over in same condition. I hope secretaries will ensure that we dont spend the budget on such things.
24/05/22, 1:24 pm - +91 89470 69850: And it's not our permanent hostel
24/05/22, 1:25 pm - Vivek Ta: In my opinion, whatever students are spending should be from Est-B charges.
24/05/22, 1:25 pm - Vivek Ta: Valid point👍
24/05/22, 1:28 pm - +91 90608 77777: This is a valid point. If we can raise this point to ccw.
24/05/22, 1:29 pm - +91 90608 77777: atleast they should be allowing some additional budget for quarantine hostel
24/05/22, 1:46 pm - +91 99780 73246: 👌👌
24/05/22, 1:55 pm - +91 97002 76503: As of now there is no such extra budget give for such repairs due to lockdown problem... hereby there are two options:
1) sending an email to CCW to give something extra due to covid and repair or buy new things (this take time may happen may not happen)
2) or repair and purchase new things and make our life easy Asap...
24/05/22, 2:17 pm - +91 80876 92627: IMO filling air can be managed from various hostels 🥲
24/05/22, 2:17 pm - +91 80876 92627: Lets use the funds for machine and dispenser and future maintenance work
24/05/22, 2:27 pm - +91 97002 76503: Ok👍🏻
24/05/22, 2:29 pm - +91 70188 46658: +1
24/05/22, 2:29 pm - +91 84365 53227: +1
24/05/22, 2:29 pm - +91 70188 46658: we can go for repairing of both old bajaj and usha irons
24/05/22, 2:32 pm - +91 97002 76503: I repaired one usha...because it was just plug damage...and other iron costs 750 rs i guess so repairing will take 250 so i purchased a new iron...
24/05/22, 3:03 pm - Vivek Ta: Was this concern already kept infront of CCW??
24/05/22, 3:04 pm - +91 97002 76503: Not yet ..
24/05/22, 3:04 pm - +91 94234 88793: Power supply is cut right?
24/05/22, 3:05 pm - +91 97110 43649: Yes
24/05/22, 3:05 pm - +91 88594 08799: Yes
24/05/22, 3:05 pm - +91 99780 73246: Anything wrong with our hostel...power cut happens daily??
24/05/22, 3:05 pm - +91 97110 43649: Is it for this hostel Or other hostels are also facing this issue?
24/05/22, 3:07 pm - Vivek Ta: Then we should take this concern to CCW through hostel manager/warden. Because when every other hostel is expanding their facilities, it is not fair only for the hostels used as quarantine to spend their budgets on basic amenities which were fine before.
24/05/22, 3:08 pm - +91 80876 92627: Other hostel as well
24/05/22, 3:08 pm - Vivek Ta: Then we should take this concern to CCW through hostel manager/warden. Because when every other hostel is expanding their facilities, it is not fair only for the hostels used as quarantine to spend their budgets on basic amenities which were fine before.
24/05/22, 3:09 pm - Vivek Ta: *quarantine centre
24/05/22, 3:09 pm - +91 97002 76503: Pls mail me your concern i will forward it to warden and he will forward to CCW and we can resolve it...
24/05/22, 3:11 pm - Vivek Ta: I think I have mentioned my concern clearly. If you want mail I can send one.
24/05/22, 3:11 pm - +91 97002 76503: Yes please send me an email  to me17d201@smail.iitm.ac.in so that we can officially ask...

24/05/22, 4:39 pm - +91 84394 30391: Partly by hostel budget and some contributions as credit funding
24/05/22, 4:40 pm - +91 84394 30391: Crowd*

24/05/22, 5:43 pm - +91 99780 73246: Its jus a temporary hostel 😅
24/05/22, 5:48 pm - +91 91136 63813: Why is everyone so sure about this? Where was this mentioned?
24/05/22, 5:49 pm - +91 99780 73246: Check smail
24/05/22, 5:49 pm - +91 99780 73246: Carefully
24/05/22, 5:49 pm - +91 89470 69850: Why?
24/05/22, 5:50 pm - +91 99780 73246: Because this things mentioned in small fonts and at the end of mail by admins😅
24/05/22, 5:51 pm - +91 89470 69850: It is a temporary hostel for 100%
24/05/22, 5:52 pm - +91 89470 69850: We have to move to Bhadra in August
24/05/22, 6:06 pm - +91 90608 77777: <Media omitted>
24/05/22, 6:07 pm - +91 87935 84232: Same happened on 1st floor 2 days back
24/05/22, 6:08 pm - +91 90608 77777: this is from first floor
24/05/22, 6:08 pm - +91 90608 77777: even this
24/05/22, 6:09 pm - +91 90608 77777: Seems like same careless guy in the first floor
24/05/22, 6:13 pm - +91 88594 08799: Bcoz they don't want to put bottle on water dispenser .
24/05/22, 6:15 pm - +91 80876 92627: This can't be tolerated. If u find whoever is doing it, request him to stop this. Ofter lid goes missing and that water is waste if something goes into the can.
24/05/22, 6:25 pm - +91 82729 09591: Since we are discussing the issue of water dispensers, can someone look into the issue of damaged dispensers? Some of the dispensers dont have the stabber point. Everytime a bottle has to be put on this kind of dispenser, a lot of water is wasted
24/05/22, 6:26 pm - +91 82729 09591: The idea is that the stabber point pierces the cap and thus there is little chance of spillage. Without that, the uncapped bottles will spill when inverted
24/05/22, 6:44 pm - +91 89470 69850: Why would you want to drink  microplastics?
24/05/22, 6:44 pm - +91 89470 69850: No need for to piercing
24/05/22, 6:44 pm - +91 89470 69850: Just remove the caps and put the bottle
24/05/22, 6:44 pm - +91 89470 69850: Thats better

24/05/22, 11:52 pm - +91 99780 73246: No new sport items (budget proposed 18500), no tv recharge,no magazine or news paper etc etc etc...i dont see much of things what was proposed!!!

Only thing which is regularly happns is maintance of washing machine and technical stuff only.

24/05/22, 11:52 pm - +91 99780 73246: And secrateries poster 😁

25/05/22, 12:07 am - +91 79087 55490: Exactly
25/05/22, 12:07 am - +91 79087 55490: I also don't know
25/05/22, 12:08 am - +91 88594 08799: 4500 for servicing those 🤣
25/05/22, 12:08 am - +91 79087 55490: They should service something else first 😂😂😂😂
25/05/22, 12:08 am - +91 88594 08799: Yeah !
25/05/22, 12:08 am - +91 88594 08799: 🤣
25/05/22, 12:09 am - +91 91567 16710: atleast find a way to recharge tv😅
25/05/22, 12:09 am - +91 79087 55490: Like literally whatever has been said nothing has been done
25/05/22, 12:10 am - +91 79087 55490: It is just looking like Research Scholars giving their RPS and saying that we'll do 100 things
And when they are giving their thesis those 100 things turn to 5-10 plausible outcomes
25/05/22, 12:11 am - +91 79087 55490: Do not take it seriously

25/05/22, 1:00 am - +91 81080 47688: Okay

25/05/22, 4:32 am - Vivek Ta: Where is the complaint book located and how to access it?
25/05/22, 4:33 am - Vivek Ta: Who needs to be contacted.?
25/05/22, 9:24 am - +91 80036 24945: Guys  for each and every mistake vankatesh sir is not responsible . He is always try his best to solve problem and he do not get salary for this work. Therefore there is responsibility for each and every member of this hostel to maintain things in proper way 🙏🏻🙏🏻
25/05/22, 9:26 am - +91 79047 57768: Absolutely correct.
25/05/22, 9:27 am - +91 81458 31742: I'm still looking for Literature secretary.....😂😂
I think he isn't in this group
25/05/22, 9:39 am - +91 94860 87050: In a social secretary budget,
1. Sweet distribution - done.
2. GBM refreshments - arranged.
3. Kitchen Items - Items purchased in first phase are available. For second phase of purchase, my advance request has to be processed.
4. Magazine will be purchased after financial advance. In addition to that, Clock will be purchased for entrance.
5. Music Items - This semester service is not planned. Because there is a shortage of water dispenser (7 second dispenser needs in all floor + 2 taken as loan from Thamirabarani hostel). So I initiated to buy one from social budget in addition to technical budget (3 proposed). Submitted a request to manager already, he has to process it. However I will ask Manager sir to place music instruments in that room. So that the instruments which didn't require service can be used. If possible, any fund available at the end of semester from other budget proposed, can be used to repair it. Or else, Music room serving can be done next semester. Kitchen room will be ready by this month end mostly.
25/05/22, 9:42 am - +91 94860 87050: All I need is financial approval from management side.
25/05/22, 9:54 am - +91 88853 66406: Complaint book at security guard place.  U can write ur complaints.
25/05/22, 10:07 am - +91 84393 73413: in 4th floor, since we arrived here, why are these common reading room, gym room locked? even after cleaning. that doesn't require any financial expenses just cleaning.
We do have drums and foosball table but don't know  why its not available.
25/05/22, 10:10 am - +91 94860 87050: Reading room/ Library will come under Literary Secretary

Gym room will come under Sports Secretary.

Anyway I will inform the manager personally regarding this and respected secretaries.
25/05/22, 10:12 am - +91 94860 87050: * respective secretaries
25/05/22, 10:16 am - +91 84393 73413: this can be done even without literary and sports secretaries and I am guessing that doesn't require too much paperwork and bureaucracy.
25/05/22, 10:19 am - +91 84394 30391: Have raised this issue earlier as well , regarding access to reading room , but didn't get any response 
I Don't think much effort is needed to restore it to working condition
25/05/22, 11:10 am - +91 94860 87050: Library is in operational for last two weeks. Students are using it for Placement preparation. 

Key can be availed from security desk.

25/05/22, 3:57 pm - +91 97002 76503: Hi @919486087050 it will be better if you can give the users like guidelines how to use the kitchen room.
On hygiene and cleaning or kitchen utensils..
Some students previously cleaned the pans using wire scrubber which damages the life of such utensils..
25/05/22, 4:00 pm - +91 80036 24945: Thnks sir for this wonderfully work
25/05/22, 4:00 pm - +91 90608 77777: But this time, any equipments bought, please  ask manager to keep the warranty card and bills safe

25/05/22, 4:52 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yes.. please use it in a proper manner. If in  anyone's hand it may be damaged then that person has to take responsibility(consequences) about those utensils. Please don't take it as a warning. Just our job.
25/05/22, 4:52 pm - +91 88853 66406: Enjoy brother
25/05/22, 4:53 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yes
25/05/22, 4:53 pm - +91 90608 77777: Please do keep the windows open all the time in kitchen
25/05/22, 5:58 pm - +91 94860 87050: Ok. Instructions will be placed by tomorrow
25/05/22, 6:00 pm - +91 94860 87050: Monkey problem may arise bro. So it will be better to keep that door closed. Whenever someone is using that room, he can open and close once cooking finished.
25/05/22, 6:08 pm - +91 79047 57768: Where's this kitchen ???
25/05/22, 6:13 pm - Vivek Ta: Closing the only exit point in a fire hazardous area is not advisable. During normal operation the main hostel gate will be closed and access is through biometric validation. So there will be no monkey issues. For now, kindly resort to other solution. Don't close the kitchen door while cooking.
25/05/22, 6:43 pm - +91 94860 87050: Just opposite to hostel entrance

01/06/22, 6:37 pm - +91 88594 08799: Already we have watercoolers . You should buy new washing machines .
01/06/22, 6:40 pm - +91 88899 29667: +1
01/06/22, 6:49 pm - +91 97002 76503: Thanks for the advice but we are also short of water cooler as of date we have borrowed two water cooler from other hostels so we have to return them...also i have projected the same in my budget...👍🏻
01/06/22, 6:52 pm - +91 97002 76503: And we have repaired total 4 semi automatic and 2 new purchase excluding the one those are already fitted...if we fall short and budget is there i will initiate purchase of one more semi automatic machine mid of this month
01/06/22, 8:10 pm - +91 80876 92627: Why semi? People have no bounds while loading semi automatic machines. The drier of semi machine is very unstable and with high load can cause damage to the motor. That will only lead to more maintainence cost.
01/06/22, 8:11 pm - +91 80876 92627: Automatic machines are relatively stable and wont accept heavy loads.
01/06/22, 8:14 pm - +91 80876 92627: Please give it a thought and consider this. In tapti hostel as all machined were semi automatic, the motor used to get damaged frequently there.
01/06/22, 8:52 pm - +91 70921 52211: automatics suck tho, 45-50 minutes of timer usually goes on up to 2+ hours. Semis are quick and efficient.

01/06/22, 9:04 pm - +91 81458 31742: They are not induction compatible
01/06/22, 9:05 pm - +91 70039 54884: That's because they are old  and no proper maintaining though previously
01/06/22, 9:06 pm - +91 95535 34691: This is because the filter is dirty. Which is making the water run slow
01/06/22, 9:12 pm - +91 81600 18164: Take clothes from re-26.
01/06/22, 9:12 pm - +91 81600 18164: Rr*
01/06/22, 9:14 pm - +91 80876 92627: Thats because of water flow
01/06/22, 10:02 pm - +91 97002 76503: As per my experience ....semi automatic maintanence is very less when compared to automatic for example frequently we get PE sensor problem the cost of the sensor is 1500+ labour On the other hand the repair cost for the semi automatic including the spin motor is 1800 rs ...automatic machine  uses sensor or sophisticated electronic system even if one sensor is not working from many fitted in the machine the it will stop working. Thing about motor problem is true but it happens only when we overload the machine or some incidents of washing shoe in the machine..
01/06/22, 10:03 pm - +91 97002 76503: We have changed PE sensor or pressure sensor from reputed vendor urban company...but this problem is frequent recurring...
01/06/22, 10:04 pm - +91 97002 76503: On the motor repairing we also get a warrenty of 6 months..

02/06/22, 10:29 am - +91 87633 74318: This is mostly possible in semi automatic.
Mostly some papers remaining in washing machine turn into small bits and stick to clothes .

This mostly happens in automatic . In semi - automatic this can be removed easily.
02/06/22, 10:40 am - +91 70039 54884: They are not papers they are dirt from previous washes stuck in the magic filter which needs replacement badly
02/06/22, 10:41 am - +91 80036 24945: This is students responsibility to check the cloths pocket before put into the washing machine so the problem of paper stick to cloths is prevented ... Many of responsible great students wash their underwear in washing machine 👏 this will create skin problem to other students
02/06/22, 10:41 am - +91 80036 24945: Please wash underwear separately
02/06/22, 10:42 am - +91 87633 74318: Yup correct....dirt along with papers too ....

04/06/22, 3:45 pm - +91 87633 74318: Kindly de-clog the drain and put back the washing machine we had
04/06/22, 3:45 pm - +91 87633 74318: 🤭
04/06/22, 3:46 pm - +91 87633 74318: We need to get hold of the manager....🤦🏻‍♂️
04/06/22, 3:46 pm - +91 88594 08799: Next level Idea 💡
04/06/22, 3:46 pm - +91 97002 76503: This machine is repaired this is not that machine...
04/06/22, 3:46 pm - +91 88882 36623: Similarly one day you will remove us to solve all the problems.
04/06/22, 3:47 pm - +91 97002 76503: Good one but one machine will be installed but not in that rr number on the same floor some other rest room
04/06/22, 3:47 pm - +91 87633 74318: Ok then
04/06/22, 3:47 pm - +91 87633 74318: Hope they put it in 14
04/06/22, 3:48 pm - +91 97002 76503: We cannot hope anything wherever there is proper facility to keep the machine manager will install there ...
04/06/22, 3:49 pm - +91 97002 76503: Manager is finding location for installation
04/06/22, 3:51 pm - +91 87633 74318: I feel only de-clogging was the requirement.
Anyways it's a complicated problem.

Just a query ...

04/06/22, 3:53 pm - +91 87633 74318: Bdw thanks to technical secretary for doing everything at his end .

Atleast each floor has one washing machine
04/06/22, 3:53 pm - +91 97002 76503: 🙏🏼🙏🏼

04/06/22, 3:54 pm - +91 79087 55490: The manager is inefficient
And some of the secretaries are also inefficient
04/06/22, 3:54 pm - +91 79087 55490: Hard way it is to say but i Will anyway say
04/06/22, 3:54 pm - +91 97002 76503: Machine repair will take time and budget... That why every floor has been give a new replacement machine .
04/06/22, 3:55 pm - +91 79087 55490: I am not able to clean my clothes for about 10 days
04/06/22, 3:55 pm - +91 79087 55490: Is it a joke or what?
04/06/22, 3:56 pm - +91 97002 76503: Pls check the notice board there it is mentioned which are the replacement machines kept on your floor...

04/06/22, 4:00 pm - +91 79087 55490: *Change the Filter ASAP*
Is it not audible enough to secretaries and manager?
04/06/22, 4:01 pm - +91 97002 76503: The machine is replaced brother...your machine is in ground floor for repair
04/06/22, 4:01 pm - +91 97002 76503: It takes time
04/06/22, 4:01 pm - +91 79087 55490: How many days for a filter 
1 month
1 year 😂😂😂😂😂
04/06/22, 4:01 pm - +91 79087 55490: What things have been repaired I just want to ask?
04/06/22, 4:02 pm - +91 79087 55490: It is the same as before
04/06/22, 4:02 pm - +91 79087 55490: Dirt comes out from it
04/06/22, 4:02 pm - +91 97002 76503: See repair is for the part not for the machine
04/06/22, 4:02 pm - +91 79087 55490: Are we cleaning our t shirts to make it dirty again 
Lol 😂😂😂
I won't
04/06/22, 4:02 pm - +91 97002 76503: This machine had PE ERROR before that has be repaired
04/06/22, 4:02 pm - +91 79087 55490: I am also telling that
But the part has not been changed
It is same as before
04/06/22, 4:03 pm - +91 79087 55490: Okay 
I humbly request you to please ask your people to change the filter
04/06/22, 4:04 pm - +91 88882 36623: They will remove the machine to solve all the issues 😂😂
04/06/22, 4:04 pm - +91 97002 76503: 👍🏻
04/06/22, 4:04 pm - +91 97002 76503: See it's not a joke...ppl give time here..
04/06/22, 4:04 pm - +91 70039 54884: Until and unless the filter is removed there is no point installing the machine
So please do at the earliest
04/06/22, 4:05 pm - +91 79087 55490: And humbleness doesn't mean that I will wait for long
If it's not done early I will take this issue to higher authorities
And please don't bound me to do that
04/06/22, 4:05 pm - +91 79087 55490: And earliest history well say that I won't think twice to do that
04/06/22, 4:05 pm - +91 97002 76503: Yes do it...might be it works...
04/06/22, 4:06 pm - +91 87633 74318: Actually it's not secretary fault....
Catch the manager....

He is executing it in wrong manner ..

After the complain rather than de-clogging he chose to remove the washing machine🤦🏻‍♂️
04/06/22, 4:08 pm - +91 97002 76503: Because he also knows it will take time meanwhile i think he shifted to some other rr
04/06/22, 4:08 pm - +91 79087 55490: Secretary is elected by manager 
So manager as well as secretaries are responsible. 
You have to be bold enough to say things here which I think many of us here are not.
04/06/22, 4:08 pm - +91 97002 76503: 👍🏻👍🏻
04/06/22, 4:09 pm - +91 88882 36623: They did the same thing few months ago

08/06/22, 8:23 pm - +91 87633 74318: Haha they changed from rr13
08/06/22, 8:23 pm - +91 87633 74318: Due to blockage
08/06/22, 8:23 pm - +91 88594 08799: After long decades we got the  washing machine ..why you want to change it's position. 🤣
08/06/22, 8:23 pm - +91 85000 92442: That's water coming into my room
08/06/22, 8:23 pm - +91 85000 92442: How can I tolerate
08/06/22, 8:24 pm - +91 88594 08799: Who washed the clothes .
08/06/22, 8:24 pm - +91 88594 08799: 🤣
08/06/22, 8:24 pm - +91 85000 92442: No cement block
08/06/22, 8:24 pm - +91 85000 92442: That's not the people issue because they need to wash their clothes ultimately
08/06/22, 8:25 pm - +91 70088 70428: bro say them to block the drainage pipe with Mseal and it wont overflow then

08/06/22, 8:32 pm - +91 88594 08799: Get well soon man.... @ respective authorities  take necessary action to kill mosquitoes 🦟.
08/06/22, 8:36 pm - +91 81080 47688: Can we do mosquitoes pest control?
08/06/22, 8:51 pm - +91 84313 34677: This is really needed. Day by day mosquitoes are increasing. I don’t know what kind of chemical is being used during fogging in hostel but its ineffective. Just the day after fogging mosquitoes appear.
08/06/22, 9:25 pm - +91 97110 43649: Yes exactly today they did fogging and still mosquitos were there
08/06/22, 9:32 pm - +91 79047 57768: Due to this water logging, mosquitoes breeds.
If drainage is proper no water logging...
08/06/22, 9:42 pm - +91 70039 54884: Water is also spilled near the water filters as well in the buckets or on the ground, please do avoid spilling water there as well
08/06/22, 9:47 pm - +91 81080 47688: I think fogging is not that effective against this mosquitoes
08/06/22, 9:50 pm - +91 85418 58847: Probably the mosquitoes just come back after the chemical dissipates 🤷‍♀️
08/06/22, 9:51 pm - +91 97110 43649: Yes I told the manager and asked him to do hit instead
08/06/22, 9:52 pm - +91 85418 58847: I just keep a bottle of Hit in my room. Spray it every time you have to use the restroom
08/06/22, 9:53 pm - +91 97110 43649: Yes it's a good idea
08/06/22, 9:54 pm - +91 97110 43649: These guys will do nothing and ultimately we have to do it to protect ourselves
08/06/22, 9:55 pm - +91 84313 34677: Yeah good idea. But I don’t think over long run its safe even for us to breathe in those chemicals
08/06/22, 9:55 pm - +91 85418 58847: Exactly. Finally I believe everyone should act on an individual level. If any one student just does this in his RR, it works for everyone using the RR
08/06/22, 9:58 pm - +91 85418 58847: Everything is a tradeoff, brother. It’s much safer that staying the mosquito infested RR, and that’s what matters
08/06/22, 10:35 pm - Vivek Ta: To the concerned person, please collect ur clothes from washing machine near RR-26.
08/06/22, 10:35 pm - Vivek Ta: I have temporarily kept it in my bucket.

It's dispensing warm water from all three taps.
Please have a look
09/06/22, 4:10 pm - +91 97002 76503: Forwarded to manager 👍🏻
09/06/22, 4:34 pm - +91 90823 99226: Does anyone have a hammer?
09/06/22, 6:09 pm - +91 97002 76503: RR2, RR6,  RR10, RR14, RR18, RR22, RR26

The above restrooms will not be functioned tomorrow due to solve the pipe line leakage issues.
09/06/22, 6:09 pm - +91 97002 76503: After 8.30 am onwards.
09/06/22, 6:09 pm - +91 97002 76503: They will start the work at 9am

10/06/22, 3:30 pm - +91 79087 55490: It is good that a new washing machine has been given in RR18.
10/06/22, 3:31 pm - +91 79087 55490: But I am really amazed that it takes years to change a magic filter of a washing machine. It's the responsibility of the secretary to convey this to manager and make him do the required thing as quick as possible.
10/06/22, 3:35 pm - +91 79087 55490: Note:
Choose your secretaries wisely next time if you guys get a chance. 
*Don't choose pupils and devotees of Manager*
10/06/22, 3:58 pm - +91 95855 71750: We neither choose this time😅.
10/06/22, 5:17 pm - +91 70251 40314: Can someone from electrical dm me..? I need some info about a course for a friend of mine....
10/06/22, 5:55 pm - +91 89849 35693: We should not blame on secretary he is putting his time apart from his academic. A little effort needed, bro pls solve the issues. And you are doing great. 😃
10/06/22, 5:57 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly that is what I want
10/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 97002 76503: Thanks already forwarded to manager....he will make the arrangements...it is taking time because part is not available in the market....
10/06/22, 6:42 pm - +91 79804 18220: @919700276503 bro, RR-27 drier not working
10/06/22, 7:15 pm - +91 97002 76503: Semi automatic??
10/06/22, 7:19 pm - +91 79804 18220: Yes
10/06/22, 7:20 pm - +91 70031 26090: Yes

10/06/22, 7:23 pm - +91 97002 76503: Ok👍🏻

10/06/22, 9:36 pm - +91 83018 85364: Where is the gym in our hostel?
10/06/22, 10:16 pm - +91 95603 94281: I think instead of changing/repairing the part, it can be cleaned easily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTeYPgxN8fs&t=214s
10/06/22, 10:17 pm - +91 95603 94281: Machines have a lot of load because of heavy usage, better to clean it regularly to maintain the hygiene
10/06/22, 10:30 pm - +91 70039 54884: Once the magic filter is fitted , we have to clean that filter before every wash
10/06/22, 10:30 pm - +91 70039 54884: There is no filter itself to clean
10/06/22, 10:52 pm - +91 88853 66406: Tq. We r doing our best bro. We r not *devotees* to anyone.
10/06/22, 10:53 pm - +91 79087 55490: That time and your deeds will decide.
10/06/22, 10:56 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yes... Everyone knows that changes in our hostel. Tq
10/06/22, 11:04 pm - +91 79087 55490: @918885366406 bro
You are speaking of Changes. In my opinion, no significant changes. 
I am asking the secretary to ask the manager to provide a new magic filter to RR17 Washing machine from Last Sunday.
10/06/22, 11:05 pm - +91 79087 55490: I know it takes time. 2-3 days is fine. 
1 month? Do you need I am approving of that as well. 
You guys just repair the washing machine before I graduate. I will be more than happy.
10/06/22, 11:17 pm - +91 97002 76503: Mr swarnadeep for you kind infro I have repaire 7 washing machines as of date in two months 
3- automatic with PE error/and other problem.
4 semi automatic machines with spin motor problem.
Kindly please have patience.
Already you have machine in your floor which is working please mean while use that already your request is forwarded to manager the repair person also is informed.It will be resolved...when you are in a system it's not easy to procure things...I appreciate your patience...you are always welcome to have a direct talk with me instead of your continuous nagging in the group....
10/06/22, 11:19 pm - +91 79087 55490: I always find your room locked and your lights off.
10/06/22, 11:19 pm - +91 79087 55490: So I had no verbal communication with you regarding this.
10/06/22, 11:19 pm - +91 97002 76503: I may be in lab...u have my number or my WhatsApp anything and time u can call me
10/06/22, 11:20 pm - +91 79087 55490: Good that you have repaired. Otherwise other people would have suffered just like me and my fellowmates in my wing.
10/06/22, 11:20 pm - +91 79087 55490: Sure I will do.
10/06/22, 11:21 pm - +91 97002 76503: I will update your tommorow about the status...and also i assure you that it will be fixed soon...mostly in next week or so...i will keep it in priority
10/06/22, 11:22 pm - +91 79087 55490: I am using the RR18 washing machine as of now. Thanks that you have provided that to us. 
Constant nagging is needed to make you remember that some people are facing problem. Otherwise I have no mean thoughts.
10/06/22, 11:23 pm - +91 97002 76503: No it's not needed instead you can DM me so that we can resolve it mutually...
10/06/22, 11:25 pm - +91 79087 55490: Sure I will do.
10/06/22, 11:26 pm - +91 79087 55490: But I thought that many people are facing the same problem. 
Then why not better discuss it here.
10/06/22, 11:36 pm - +91 95855 71750: 😄
11/06/22, 12:39 am - +91 88853 66406: I understood ur problem bro. It'll resolve soon. If u observed that altered  maintenance in our hostel then u might know about it. Firstly, washing machines, lift issues, LAN issues, sports issues, *maintenance of hostel* etc... Everything changed bro. Significant changes must be needed in a hostel to overcome the issues. We did as well.  Our hostel was damaged due to quarantine days. We r not *devotees* to the manager.  Tq bro..
11/06/22, 12:44 am - +91 88537 00390: Guys anyone having tool box to open laptop please let me know😊

I am Tej Prakash, a second-year Ph.D. research scholar in the Metallurgical and materials engineering department. I am writing this mail to get possible financial help for my father's treatment.


My father was admitted to the hospital on 14th June due to acute non-necrotizing pancreatitis but within two days, his situation worsened with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), acute kidney injury (AKI) on hemodialysis (HD), metabolic acidosis. He has been shifted to ICU from 16th July on Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) support.

Now, We are in a shortage of finances for hospital and medical expenses and need the urgent financial support of approximately Rs. 4-6 lacs.

I have attached the related documents (medical reports). 


I would be very grateful for even a tiny contribution of yours.

25/06/22, 6:14 pm - +91 97002 76503: At first muddy water will come because the pipe is not been used for days now...atleast 5 bucket water you have to remove then you will get hot water may be one of the draw back of solar system....But that's how it works
25/06/22, 6:14 pm - +91 97002 76503: That's your outlook @917003954884..
25/06/22, 6:15 pm - +91 97002 76503: Do you think i am the repair person to give you an estimate? The fact is the budget is not allocated for this semester..
25/06/22, 6:16 pm - +91 70039 54884: Ofc not,  but you can atleast get an estimate of the cost
25/06/22, 6:16 pm - +91 97002 76503: So to do what? Without budget who will pay!
25/06/22, 6:17 pm - +91 70039 54884: As seen from the condition of the geyser , only the wires need fixing in RR17.
So kindly get the estimate from the repair person when he comes

29/06/22, 10:15 am - +91 91567 16710: Water heater in rest rooms
29/06/22, 10:15 am - +91 70039 54884: We have to ask the manager to turn on the geyser
29/06/22, 10:15 am - +91 91567 16710: 👍🏻
29/06/22, 10:15 am - +91 70039 54884: He is saying that one time one geyser bursted because it was faulty
29/06/22, 10:16 am - +91 70039 54884: So none of the geyser will be turned on
29/06/22, 10:17 am - +91 70039 54884: He is asking us to use solar heaters which takes 1 hr to give hot water that too you have to empty 7 to 8 buckets of water first
29/06/22, 10:17 am - +91 98748 18871: Where are these solar heaters..????..
29/06/22, 10:18 am - +91 98748 18871: Let's all ask together, then something might happen....
29/06/22, 10:19 am - +91 90608 77777: In coming winter, solar wont work
Geyser is very much needed atleast then
29/06/22, 10:19 am - +91 98748 18871: Where are these solar heaters anyway..??..
29/06/22, 10:21 am - +91 91567 16710: Thers only one tap of cold water..we dont have it ig
29/06/22, 10:24 am - +91 70039 54884: I think it is on the side where we have the toilets, a tub shaped thing with two taps
29/06/22, 10:24 am - +91 70039 54884: Not quite sure
29/06/22, 10:24 am - +91 70039 54884: Yes we have to ask all together
29/06/22, 10:25 am - +91 70039 54884: Otherwise in the rainy season even the solar heaters won't work
29/06/22, 10:25 am - +91 70039 54884: They are just giving excuse that we forget to switch off the geyser
29/06/22, 10:26 am - +91 70039 54884: Whereas it was the geyser which was faulty
29/06/22, 10:28 am - +91 98748 18871: In rainy season it will be a huge problem if the geysers don't work....
29/06/22, 10:28 am - +91 70039 54884: Yeah
29/06/22, 11:15 am - +91 79087 55490: +1

29/06/22, 12:37 pm - +91 82729 09591: The entire solar geyser charade is pointless here in Chennai. The only time a person would need hot water here is when it rains. And obviously then the solar heater is not a viable option.
29/06/22, 12:37 pm - +91 82729 09591: Even in winter, one wouldn't need a geyser here
29/06/22, 12:38 pm - +91 80746 21056: I was really looking forward to winter 🙃
29/06/22, 12:40 pm - +91 82729 09591: Winter? What winter?😂
29/06/22, 12:41 pm - +91 70039 54884: We all need to go to the Manager and ask for the geyser otherwise we won't get anything done here
29/06/22, 12:49 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly

29/06/22, 7:55 pm - +91 86091 25776: Hi, I used to keep my lock and the keys hanging from the doorknob when I was inside the room (room 435). Today I found the lock, and the key is missing from the doorknob. Please return it to the same room if anyone has taken it by mistake.
29/06/22, 8:36 pm - +91 80053 64128: People are stealing locks in iit🤦🏻‍♂️
29/06/22, 8:37 pm - +91 85418 58847: You should replace the lock now, as the person who took the key may enter
29/06/22, 8:39 pm - +91 79087 55490: Oh gawd
29/06/22, 8:41 pm - +91 80746 21056: That would definitely have been their idea (if it in fact was a theft)
29/06/22, 8:44 pm - +91 86091 25776: The lock with keys are gone
29/06/22, 8:45 pm - +91 85418 58847: Oh, from the way you wrote it seemed as if only the key was missing
29/06/22, 8:46 pm - +91 86091 25776: My bad
29/06/22, 8:56 pm - +91 81080 47688: Please collect clothes from RR26

Most mosquitoes are coming from there
05/07/22, 1:51 am - +91 77080 72829: @health secretary @919700276503 @918885366406

05/07/22, 8:42 am - +91 85418 58847: Using an All Out you could have killed every single one of them 😅
05/07/22, 9:19 am - +91 90608 77777: All out literally doesnt work
05/07/22, 9:19 am - +91 90608 77777: Just slows them down

05/07/22, 9:21 am - +91 85418 58847: Well, at least in my room it works well 😅
05/07/22, 10:09 am - +91 89849 35693: yes today even one mosquito was just sitting near the switched on All Out machine. Now its better to use Mosquito net.
05/07/22, 10:10 am - +91 89849 35693: After that i used KALA HEAT
05/07/22, 10:14 am - +91 88594 08799: Fastcard will be better option
05/07/22, 10:14 am - +91 97110 43649: Guys please dont leave water In the bucket after using washroom I just saw lots of mosquito larvae in a bucket in RR7

05/07/22, 10:11 pm - +91 85418 58847: You may be surprised to know, but both All Out and Kala Hit have very similar active ingredients
05/07/22, 10:12 pm - +91 85418 58847: All Out has transfluthrin while Kala Hit has Allethrin
05/07/22, 10:12 pm - +91 85418 58847: Both of these are derivatives of Pyrethin, so either both should work or both shouldn’t work
05/07/22, 10:21 pm - +91 85100 64198: Came to lab
05/07/22, 10:37 pm - +91 89849 35693: The only difference is we can directly put KALA HEAT at the required place and mosquito immediately leave the place but Allout will slowly increase its effect to spread across room.
05/07/22, 10:37 pm - +91 89849 35693: As shocket place is fixed

I am receiving complaints about someone is locking the room door outside and switch off the power during the mid night when the student inside the room.
 
This is the serious case, I have already informed to the Asst.warden to monitor/check the student's rooms daily during the night time as per the Warden sir instructions.

Secretaries, please help to the Asst.Warden to solve this issues, if it is possible.

07/07/22, 3:01 pm - +91 70039 54884: Even we had water heaters back in our btech colleges which ran 24/7 and yet they worked fine. They have inbuilt thermostat which stops heating after a point.

07/07/22, 3:09 pm - +91 82484 67159: Our manager is a POS
He always promises but never does anything. He promises an exact date by which the things will be done but then it never happens.

Secretaries @919700276503 @918885366406 
Please do so and ask to start electric geysers in hostels , all the heaters are okay just need the plugs which were cut down previously.
07/07/22, 4:20 pm - +91 88853 66406: Sure brother

07/07/22, 7:20 pm - +91 79087 55490: The main thing what I feel is
The manager was very smart to involve all the secretaries and then left the group. Now if we have to show criticism to any of the things in the hostel, obviously the secretaries will get targetted. 
That's why I am requesting the secretaries to think about it once and please add pressure on manager that he has to be in this group and he can't leave this group.

07/07/22, 7:29 pm - +91 79087 55490: No he is not
07/07/22, 7:29 pm - +91 79087 55490: That is what I am saying here
07/07/22, 7:31 pm - +91 84313 34677: That’s sad. I don’t have his number. Hope the secretaries convey our situation to the manager
07/07/22, 7:32 pm - +91 79087 55490: Arrey they are conveying mostly. He doesn't wants to work for the good of the hostel.
07/07/22, 7:33 pm - +91 79087 55490: Manager always says that he will be doing but he doesn't do anything. 
And when you scream at him, then only he works.

07/07/22, 9:04 pm - +91 79087 55490: This time I am not saying you are devotee to them. 
@SANKAR my bed was changed after a constant nagging of 1 month although the spare bed was near my room
He has to be in the group. Ask other friends of yours from different hostel. Like wtf is this 
Manager is the one who manages the hostel and he is not here. You guys are bashed for no concrete reason.
07/07/22, 9:08 pm - +91 79087 55490: And why I said devotees earlier? Here's the reason for it:
See in the hostel 400-500 people lives. You need to come to a conclusion based on a larger sample size and that can be done only by elections. And what manager did? He called 7-10 people and decided them as coordinators for the hostel. 
What I am trying to say is! 
7-10 people sample size is not equivalent to 400-500 sample size. 
And if he calls 7-10 specific people only obviously you people are the favourites of Manager.
07/07/22, 9:09 pm - +91 88853 66406: Amogh, I'll ask him to clean the tanks. Sorry for that.
07/07/22, 9:09 pm - +91 79087 55490: And now for no reason 
You guys are getting bashed whereas Manager needs to be bashed for not doing his work.
07/07/22, 9:10 pm - +91 6351 255 053: +1
07/07/22, 9:15 pm - +91 88853 66406: Brother, TQ for ur support. To activate the establishment fund of this hostel, counsil needed for that. So that, we came forward to do. Our counsil upto July only. He'll conduct elections n elect them.
07/07/22, 9:15 pm - +91 88853 66406: I'm not supporting him brother. I'm student like u here. Tq
07/07/22, 9:16 pm - +91 77080 72829: Who is the assistant manager? He is in group right?
07/07/22, 9:16 pm - +91 79087 55490: Better you don't support him
Now because of him you guys are getting bashed
And make a strong voice and ask him to be in the group

07/07/22, 11:04 pm - +91 97002 76503: @917908755490 kindly please be informed that  some aspect of this hostel is running by maintenance team like by CCW example washroom washing tank cleaning etc.., for this  manager can be accountable...And for somethings like repair maintain of hostel property and amenity comes under hostel budget purview....As u are saying to repair geyser and multiple u have msged u have contacted me I had already said that aspect is not in the budget this sem...Then what is the ambiguity.... For your information the money which comes under every secretary is clearly accounted and the plan to spend the money is put forthwith the students in the GBM which was attended by only a few very responsible students who gave there opinion to what to prioritise this sem and accordingly the budget was decided asper the budget many aspects of this hostel are already improved or some new amenities are already purchase
07/07/22, 11:05 pm - +91 97002 76503: Kindly have some patience.... without budget you speak up complain or do whatever the geyser or any other thing which is not in the budget purview cannot be taken care ..
07/07/22, 11:09 pm - +91 97002 76503: With respect to geyser let me make it clear you go to warden manger or anywhere it cannot be take care atleast in this sem because the budget was not alloted its simple it's not rocket science...
07/07/22, 11:15 pm - +91 70039 54884: Dude it takes 200 rs to replace a plug
07/07/22, 11:15 pm - +91 70039 54884: The manager said they intentionally cut the plug so that no one can use it
07/07/22, 11:15 pm - +91 70039 54884: Rest the geyser works fine
07/07/22, 11:15 pm - +91 97002 76503: Dude it take 200×no of washrooms to repair at minimum....
07/07/22, 11:16 pm - +91 6351 255 053: Venkatesh bro can explain me why we are paying  hostel fees, and still getting excuses about budget. I am not here to manage any budget and other things.
07/07/22, 11:16 pm - +91 97002 76503: And if it's 200 also who will give will I give or will u give ...what I are asking bro
07/07/22, 11:16 pm - +91 70039 54884: You can start one  geyser in each floor at least
07/07/22, 11:17 pm - +91 70039 54884: Or in floor where people need it
07/07/22, 11:17 pm - +91 70039 54884: Might not be every floor
07/07/22, 11:17 pm - +91 97002 76503: Hi...good question whatever fee you pay from that some share of establishment fee comes to us per semester which is dividend among secretaries head ...so it's limited not a unlimited pool of money
07/07/22, 11:18 pm - +91 6351 255 053: And we are not asking anything extra, but hot water due to rainy season. The defination of 'manager' is to manage and solve the problems not to give excuses.
07/07/22, 11:18 pm - +91 97002 76503: Buddy but whatever you are asking is not in the budget this sem...
07/07/22, 11:18 pm - +91 6351 255 053: So am I here to study the fees distribution of students!!!!
07/07/22, 11:19 pm - +91 97002 76503: That's your right actually...

07/07/22, 11:20 pm - +91 77080 72829: Ok bro. If u r right away saying geyser repair is not possible this sem.... Then are we allowed to use immersion heater in our rooms?
07/07/22, 11:21 pm - +91 97002 76503: @917003954884 budget is not alloted even for one rest room...and even if we start one restroom budget is needed thing even we manage budget some how what answer will I give about the money spent which was not accounted...it's not accepted
07/07/22, 11:21 pm - +91 97002 76503: Pls ask warden👍🏻
07/07/22, 11:22 pm - +91 70039 54884: When is the next GBM meeting where we will know how much budget is left that you can't send even 200 rs on a geyser
07/07/22, 11:22 pm - +91 97002 76503: Who knows !
07/07/22, 11:22 pm - +91 70039 54884: And if you can't we will give 200 from our pocket to fix it
07/07/22, 11:22 pm - +91 77080 72829: Yeah👍
07/07/22, 11:22 pm - +91 70039 54884: Aren't you supposed to know?

07/07/22, 11:22 pm - +91 97002 76503: How m i suppose to know!
07/07/22, 11:23 pm - +91 70039 54884: Fine get the permission from the Manager on it and we will get it done
07/07/22, 11:23 pm - +91 70039 54884: You are the secretary so why not
07/07/22, 11:23 pm - +91 97002 76503: Kindly do it by yourself if you can do the same for the whole hostel then I can discuss with the warden ...
07/07/22, 11:24 pm - +91 97002 76503: I am not the one who conducts the GBM!
07/07/22, 11:25 pm - +91 70039 54884: I will do only for the restroom we are using say RR17.
And as a secretary shouldn't you be mailing the warden regarding the problem
07/07/22, 11:25 pm - +91 97002 76503: Thing is everything needs budget but when the GBM is there not even 50 PPL attended...that's the problem...in GBM PPL present clearly said that geyser is not needed in this sem...I was there ask PPL who where there in GBM...
07/07/22, 11:26 pm - +91 97002 76503: Yeah first you mail to me i will forward your request...why I will be mailing?

07/07/22, 11:28 pm - +91 84393 73413: there are people in the hostel those needed geyser right now. They're feeling severe cold and sore throat.
07/07/22, 11:29 pm - +91 84393 73413: I think you can understand
07/07/22, 11:29 pm - +91 97002 76503: I understand...i will put your word infront of warden...if he can arrange budget then we can do something...
07/07/22, 11:30 pm - +91 97002 76503: Even I want geyser...👍🏻
07/07/22, 11:30 pm - +91 6351 255 053: Bro but he doesn't care, every sem they will take hostel fees but they cannot fullfill basic needs in hostel giving reasons of budget and all that....
07/07/22, 11:31 pm - +91 6351 255 053: Even they have the right to directly cut the fees from scholars HTRA
07/07/22, 11:31 pm - +91 77080 72829: +1. Forward our mail too. Plz send id
07/07/22, 11:31 pm - +91 97002 76503: How do u know what i care and what not donot even try to use sarcasm on me...

07/07/22, 11:32 pm - +91 97002 76503: 😄
07/07/22, 11:32 pm - +91 6351 255 053: So we paying fees is sarcasm to you!!!!
07/07/22, 11:33 pm - +91 97002 76503: Stop nonsense buddy don't make a personal comment on me...what u wrote in the previous msg was personal...
07/07/22, 11:33 pm - +91 6351 255 053: I am not against you or anyone, but the main problem comes with the manager..
07/07/22, 11:34 pm - +91 97002 76503: Who is he! Why u wrote he ..who are you to decide what i care and what my views are...I too want geyser...
07/07/22, 11:34 pm - +91 6351 255 053: Who should be in the group but is not available!!
07/07/22, 11:34 pm - +91 97002 76503: Main problem is the budget...
07/07/22, 11:34 pm - +91 97002 76503: You can discuss with manager and warden about being in the group...
07/07/22, 11:37 pm - +91 77080 72829: Solar heater also there na. But it needs maintenance also. I hope that too doesn't need budget allocation
07/07/22, 11:37 pm - +91 70039 54884: <Media omitted>
07/07/22, 11:38 pm - +91 97002 76503: What's the need to show here I can read it on my email and even u can get the update from warden
07/07/22, 11:39 pm - +91 97002 76503: For that manger is accountable
07/07/22, 11:40 pm - +91 70039 54884: I wrote it on everyone's behalf so posted it here as well, didn't see anything wrong in it
07/07/22, 11:40 pm - +91 97002 76503: U can ask him because for that budget comes from CCW directly...if u are not getting hot water or dirt then they must repair..
07/07/22, 11:40 pm - +91 97002 76503: How...you wrote so your request na ...
07/07/22, 11:42 pm - +91 77080 72829: Bro.. Change as to all RR. We all can pay 200₹ fr each geyser.
07/07/22, 11:42 pm - +91 97002 76503: Actually how water will come but you must waste 7 bucket water then hot water will come...it also sound very illogical for me and we should not do that but that what the technological aspect of this solar heater is...
07/07/22, 11:43 pm - +91 97002 76503: I will mention that all the rr  is having same problem
07/07/22, 11:43 pm - +91 70039 54884: Who has so much time and patience to empty 7 buckts of water
07/07/22, 11:43 pm - +91 70039 54884: 😂
07/07/22, 11:43 pm - +91 77080 72829: Even then frothy water comes with disgusting smell. Skin infection is definite
07/07/22, 11:43 pm - +91 70039 54884: Thanks
07/07/22, 11:43 pm - +91 97002 76503: Inefficient system sue CCW then...
07/07/22, 11:43 pm - +91 98748 18871: @919700276503  Bro, you said that geyser problem cannot be taken care of this sem because budget is not allocated....and possibly the sem you are speaking is Jul-Nov 2022....yesterday it rained and the water was quite cold, after taking a bath I caught sneezing and cold related symptoms, on the very same night....I am pretty sure there are others also who are facing this issue....Now, can anyone, be the secretary, manager, warden, etc tell it clearly that the students need to face this kind of health issues for the upcoming 5-6 months because fund is not allocated in the budget for geyser purpose..??..We, the students, need a clear cut answer to this question....Is it that the students have to bear the burden of the fund not being allocated to geyser purpose at the cost of their health for 5-6 months, even after duly paying hostel fees and performing all the required formalities..??..It's not that I am or we are blaming you bro, but we do need an answer to this question as it is our right to know it....and since the manager, warden, etc are not in this group, we are bound to put this question to you, you may ask them the question if you need or give the answer yourself....But we do need an answer to this question posted in this group....
07/07/22, 11:44 pm - +91 97002 76503: Cleaning CCW...i will inform the manager Tommorow let's write a email to CCW as well
07/07/22, 11:44 pm - +91 97002 76503: No only till June is this sem

07/07/22, 11:45 pm - +91 97002 76503: I understand even I have same cold problem..
07/07/22, 11:45 pm - +91 97002 76503: But if accountability is asked who to account??
07/07/22, 11:47 pm - +91 97002 76503: If I ask money from manager will he give...if I ask money to warden will he give....will CCW give ...?? As a representative tell me whome to ask
07/07/22, 11:48 pm - +91 97002 76503: They will say budget was given to us and full freedom was given to us
 to decide....
07/07/22, 11:49 pm - +91 98748 18871: If that is it, then it is already July 8th tomorrow....there should be a new budget impending soon then for the upcoming Jul-Nov semester..??..please get funds allocated for the geyser in it....
07/07/22, 11:50 pm - +91 97002 76503: I am only your representative till July this sem...next budget will be give to new person or who is elected after election...he will do that...if I stay i will surely take up..👍🏻
07/07/22, 11:52 pm - +91 97002 76503: Untill the next representative is elected my duty is to wind-up things and see that what i promised is delivered....👍🏻
07/07/22, 11:54 pm - +91 98748 18871: No no....We the students just want their answer to the question I asked....Funds are not allocated, we understand that, just say whether the solution to it is bearing with our health....
07/07/22, 11:55 pm - +91 98748 18871: Again I remind bro, we have nothing against you, no complaints....it is just that we are facing it so we are speaking it up, we are not getting manager, warden, etc, so we are puuting it to you....
07/07/22, 11:55 pm - +91 97002 76503: My answer is kindly write to manger warden CCW....what answer should I give will give money from my pocket..
07/07/22, 11:56 pm - +91 97002 76503: Bro it's mail just in mail you ask them
07/07/22, 11:56 pm - +91 97002 76503: That's official route i guess

08/07/22, 12:41 am - +91 77080 72829: Anyone know why manager cut off the plugs for all geysers?
08/07/22, 12:49 am - +91 97002 76503: I think CCW order

08/07/22, 12:53 am - +91 77080 72829: Ok. But what may b issue? Short circuit can't happen as geyser is automatic. Maybe power consumption limit?? 🤔
08/07/22, 12:53 am - +91 77080 72829: If that's the case.. Why will they allow now?
08/07/22, 12:53 am - +91 97002 76503: What i heard is some incidence happened some geyser blast or something
08/07/22, 12:55 am - +91 97002 76503: They must allow geyser or they must make the heater efficient...
08/07/22, 12:55 am - +91 97002 76503: CCW has to do this ...we have sent our mail request to warden let's wait and see what he suggests and reply...
08/07/22, 12:57 am - +91 77080 72829: Ok. Thanq. Let's see
08/07/22, 12:57 am - +91 79087 55490: @919700276503 
Thanks for being vocal after a very long time. I hope the long discussion here was enough for you to understand why I asked for it 
And why people need the most right now!!
08/07/22, 12:58 am - +91 97002 76503: Pleasure helping you guys ...change happens when ppl start asking for it in a proper way ..👍🏻
08/07/22, 12:58 am - +91 97002 76503: 👍🏻👍🏻
08/07/22, 1:01 am - +91 79087 55490: And they are asking it in a proper way itself. See that's why I am only saying that
*Manager should be in the group*
The long discussion we had in WhatsApp. He is not the one who is reading a single message here, you guys are doing that. 
It is just like you guys are doing his part of the work which is kinda mean.
08/07/22, 1:01 am - +91 97002 76503: This is not a medium of official communication swarnadeep...let's make things official ...
08/07/22, 1:02 am - +91 97002 76503: We did things in official way...now manager warden CCW everyone is in loop...let's see who answers...👍🏻
08/07/22, 1:03 am - +91 97002 76503: It's his personal choice to not be in the group...what we can do is write an official mail to warden regarding the same to add the manager in the group
08/07/22, 1:03 am - +91 79087 55490: @919700276503 
I am also asking for Fumigation also from two days. Is it a difficult task to do? I don't think so. 
And the long long discussion regarding geyser is quite enough for everyone to comprehend that why it is needed.
08/07/22, 1:04 am - +91 97002 76503: Pls write directly to warden he will set the manager right...
08/07/22, 1:04 am - +91 97002 76503: This is how it works in this kind of organisation...

08/07/22, 1:05 am - +91 97002 76503: Group is getting disturbed pls let's discuss in person!
08/07/22, 1:06 am - +91 79087 55490: @919700276503 
You do one thing. You ask your friends from other hostels whether the manager is there in their whatsApp group or not and I will rest my case because I also don't want it like that.
08/07/22, 1:06 am - +91 79087 55490: And being harsh on you guys won't do anything to me.
08/07/22, 1:07 am - +91 79087 55490: Ya I will do that in morning.
08/07/22, 1:07 am - +91 97002 76503: You tell me one thing if u ask me what i can do?? M also a student do I have a authority on manager!
08/07/22, 1:07 am - +91 79087 55490: *Make the manager be in the group first lol 😂*
08/07/22, 1:08 am - +91 97002 76503: Y he will listen to me if he is not listening to you...so warden is the person to contact...
08/07/22, 1:09 am - +91 97002 76503: Write a mail i will forward or the secretaries will forward...
08/07/22, 1:09 am - +91 79087 55490: No you don't have 
But the thing is when you guys are appointed as secretaries for the hostel by the manager and warden
You guys have to be bold enough to say the problems to manager first
But manager being the first point of communication is working very ineffectively.
08/07/22, 1:09 am - +91 79087 55490: Sure I won't drag it

08/07/22, 11:04 am - +91 97002 76503: In my personal experience today at rr2 hot water comes after 6 buckets of water wastage...
08/07/22, 11:07 am - +91 94477 53083: Usually, hot water is needed in rainy days. Rainy days will be cloudy and solar water heaters will not be working as expected.
08/07/22, 11:08 am - +91 97002 76503: I have asked the same but there seems to be a technology which also works during winter and rainy season ....today it's cloudy but we got hot water after 6 buckets....
08/07/22, 11:15 am - +91 94477 53083: Winter it will work. Because during day time there is enough sunlight. May be that converted energy is stored somehow for several hours also. But during rainy season, sunlight will be low in average. I dont know how that issue can be solved without any other power sources.
08/07/22, 11:16 am - +91 97002 76503: I am unaware of the technological aspect of this solar hot water heater but let's see if in rainy season we don't get water after 7 buckets then we will complain to the authorities....
08/07/22, 11:17 am - +91 70039 54884: Hope they will take instant action like they always do 🙃

09/07/22, 7:22 pm - +91 94860 87050: Budget approval from GBM may be in August. Not sure about exact date.

One acoustic guitar is repaired this semester. Another acoustic and electric guitar will be repaired next sem along with new purchases.

Music Room (before Covid) is now used by hostel staff. So now it is in common room of 3rd room. 

If you want to use it (repaired acoustic guitar) get key from manager by making entry with him. But the full fledged operational like before Covid is possible in next sem bro.
09/07/22, 7:54 pm - +91 87635 65135: Any idea when interhostel matches will start
09/07/22, 7:57 pm - +91 98748 18871: In that next GBM meeting, please sanction some fund from the budget for geyser purpose....

Please make some effort and. Holding a leadership position does make you accountable to do on the behalf of us and it shows your leadership.

10/07/22, 12:27 am - +91 88853 66406: Our counsil upto July only. Till now what we decided about washing machines, water dispensers, kitchen utensils, sports issues, LAN, lift( continuous problem), hostel hygienics issues etc. resolved by my team successfully. Now coming to the point, those music.. etc. Issues will sort out by the next counsil only bcz establishment amount will activate by forming the counsil only. We can't do anything now about music things etc..  TQ for ur understanding brother
10/07/22, 9:22 am - +91 94860 87050: See regarding Music Room issue, I already informed about the same in group way back in May. After other commitments, I had around Rs 1000, So I used it to get repair of one acoustic guitar. Kitchen and Music rooms are requiring around some 20000 for full fledged operation. How I can do it both with my 45000+ Allocation? I had put efforts from my side for what I have committed for this semester.
TQ.
10/07/22, 9:45 am - +91 84313 34677: May I please know what was the repair that cost almost a third of the money needed to buy a cheap guitar?
10/07/22, 9:47 am - +91 84313 34677: Opening music room gives opportunity to find fellow musicians. I found one such friend through a jamming session.
10/07/22, 9:49 am - +91 84313 34677: Some of us have instruments of our own and can have jamming sessions if the music room is open
10/07/22, 10:05 am - +91 94860 87050: The string change along with service costs Rs.960.
10/07/22, 11:16 am - +91 80053 64128: Life is not working

10/07/22, 11:49 am - +91 85418 58847: Lift is easier to repair, so maybe we will focus on that for now 😅😅
10/07/22, 11:54 am - +91 99693 94156: RR17: take your clothes out of the machine
10/07/22, 12:13 pm - +91 99693 94156: Take your clothes from my bucket kept besides.
10/07/22, 12:31 pm - +91 98748 18871: RR16 washing machine has become tricky for quite a few days now....any update on it..??..It is not willing to wash our clothes..🐸..and if placed in it, it is stoping the wash midway everytime....🌝
10/07/22, 1:29 pm - +91 84313 34677: Oh😳. I think that’s too expensive.
10/07/22, 2:31 pm - +91 94860 87050: The String Set itself costs Rs.710. Serviced at Raj Royal Musicals, Velachery.
10/07/22, 2:31 pm - +91 96741 12479: Is it acoustic guitar??
10/07/22, 2:32 pm - +91 94860 87050: If anyone wants to see the bill, I will arrange it next week.
10/07/22, 2:33 pm - +91 94860 87050: If you can get it repaired with less cost for the other Guitar, It would be helpful for our hostel. Kindly help me in next sem or the newly elected secretary bro
10/07/22, 2:52 pm - +91 96742 12703: Medium tension string?
10/07/22, 2:52 pm - +91 84313 34677: What kind of strings bro. I got carbon light strings of D’Addario from amazon for 300 and they work like charm.
10/07/22, 2:55 pm - +91 95603 94281: We were allocated a budget for Handwash, was it used?😶
10/07/22, 2:55 pm - +91 84313 34677: You just open the instrument room and let people check it. I can change guitar string myself. I also have guitar polish which can help clean it and make it look new. Wood work we might need help from outside but I don’t know if it costs that much
10/07/22, 3:15 pm - +91 94860 87050: Ok. I will speak with manager regarding photocopy of service bill. Whoever have doubt, they can come and check it. 

Between i have completed my commitments for this semester. 

It will be useful for our hostel, if a Student get it repaired on his own. 

Instrument room key is available in office room only, which is informed already in the group. I have nothing with opening/closing a room.
Thanks.

They might say a person should not sleep more than 4 hrs in his student phase. So all the best for forcing them to take some action which actually has influence.

20/07/22, 12:15 pm - +91 81458 31742: Maybe only in his room

20/07/22, 2:05 pm - +91 84393 73413: fogging in ground floor doesn't mean it go to every floor. Since the fog doesn't know machine learning so it can't change path and will to go each floor..they have to it every floor
20/07/22, 2:05 pm - +91 84393 73413: 🤣
20/07/22, 2:07 pm - +91 88537 00390: Don't worry.. First fog will knock your door and will ask permission to spread over in your room..
20/07/22, 2:13 pm - +91 99780 73246: Fogging is not a permanent solution... think about alternatives
Why should we live in a polluted place every day!!!
20/07/22, 2:14 pm - +91 84393 73413: permanent solution is to submit your thesis ASAP🤣

29/07/22, 10:15 am - +91 70039 54884: Why is the magic filter broken for this washing machine?
We bought it new in June only.
@918885366406

29/07/22, 10:29 am - +91 79087 55490: @918885366406 
Magic filter issue was sorted. Magic filter was there before I came. He is asking where the Magic filter went.
29/07/22, 10:29 am - +91 79087 55490: It was bought in June. The magic filter don't goes that easily.
29/07/22, 10:32 am - +91 88853 66406: Read it. He told about broken. It didn't go anywhere.

29/07/22, 10:34 am - +91 70039 54884: Magic filters needs to be cleaned after every wash
29/07/22, 10:34 am - +91 79087 55490: @918885366406 
Do something for this
29/07/22, 10:34 am - +91 88853 66406: Bcz misusing by the students only.

Everytime did that 
But everyone doesn't follow
29/07/22, 10:35 am - +91 79087 55490: Here students don't properly clean the toilet pans what more to expect in that case
29/07/22, 10:37 am - +91 88853 66406: Then what we can do Mukherjee. They should have to know how to use washing machines then only life time will increases.
29/07/22, 10:37 am - +91 79087 55490: Ya I understand
29/07/22, 10:37 am - +91 79087 55490: That very well

29/07/22, 10:43 am - +91 88853 66406: I think they don't know, it is our money. We r spending from our accounttttt onlyyy.. they r giving fund which was paid by us. We knew everything even though we'll do n break them. Whatever it is do it. That amount is spending some unnecessary things. Fund is spending always repair n repair, repair..... Then how we can buy a new things. Think about ittttt frnds..
29/07/22, 11:05 am - +91 90608 77777: Dude. Many research scholars like me have been here even before you joined and have been through all these things before too. For sure, we know how to use it better than others. Better not blame for everyrhing on the research scholars. Just get your facts correct
29/07/22, 11:07 am - +91 90608 77777: I have seen some many Mtech, MS and MSc students do stupid things. will you start blaming for these on research scholars too ?
29/07/22, 11:09 am - +91 88853 66406: I not blaming u bother. I knew it. I told about who did like that. I'm also research scholar.
29/07/22, 11:10 am - +91 89470 69850: People get offended easily now a days

29/07/22, 11:11 am - +91 90608 77777: Saying " Theyvare research scholars" is too generic man. Just be careful with your words.
29/07/22, 11:11 am - +91 90608 77777: Doesnt give a good impression if it comes from a secretary
29/07/22, 11:18 am - +91 88853 66406: Yes brother. Fund is spending for repairs only. We can't able to buy new things.  In that context,  I told like that brother. Sorry for that brother. TQ brother
29/07/22, 11:23 am - +91 88853 66406: No MSc students in our hostel brother
29/07/22, 11:24 am - +91 90608 77777: Yeah, not currently
29/07/22, 11:24 am - +91 90608 77777: Its alright
29/07/22, 1:42 pm - +91 70251 40314: It's very clear that at least a small percentage of people are not using the facilities properly. Every day there is a new complaint. In some hostels, they have this system where the washing machine switch will be locked, and if we need to use it we have to write our details and get the key from security. The machine will be allotted for 2 hours or something..  this way people will have to show more responsibility. 
Is it possible to implement some similar system here in our hostel?? @secretaries

29/07/22, 2:48 pm - +91 80876 92627: Only thing I know is that it doesn’t come under cmgfs and ccw. You can try mailing DoSt or if there is some admin email id

15/08/22, 7:55 pm - +91 70039 50664: 🤣🤣today even I saw there is some event in pampa hostel where ice creams are being distributed🙁 i don't know why our hostel doesn't have these things
15/08/22, 7:56 pm - +91 85115 65232: That's why yesterday I was asking how many clothes i can wash 😅
15/08/22, 7:57 pm - +91 70039 50664: 🤣🤣
15/08/22, 7:58 pm - +91 84313 34677: All the money went for washing machines I guess. No parties, sweets or geysers this sem
15/08/22, 7:58 pm - +91 98842 99098: May be we are poor enough to distribute sweets on Independence day
15/08/22, 7:59 pm - +91 89849 35693: I want to meet with the hostel's gardener who kept the manhole's lid partially opened 😅
15/08/22, 8:15 pm - +91 85100 64198: This is where you use your theatrical skills and play the lead role of being a resident of Pampa hostel
15/08/22, 8:21 pm - +91 87633 74318: I feel since this was made a COVID hostel we are having these problems......
We are mostly at loss due to this
15/08/22, 8:22 pm - +91 87633 74318: College shd give more fund to hostels that were COVID hostels
15/08/22, 8:22 pm - +91 97110 43649: Pampa was also covid hostel
15/08/22, 8:22 pm - +91 97110 43649: I don't know why in this hostel only all machines are defective
15/08/22, 8:23 pm - +91 70039 50664: Whatever it is, the college fund should be distributed to all hostels equally.... We are paying same amount that is being paid by other hostel residents
15/08/22, 8:24 pm - +91 70039 50664: This is the most neglected hostel I feel, bro, we are not damaging any lifts, but our lifts are worst among all hostels, even after all those things, administration are not worried about these things. Same with washing machines
15/08/22, 8:31 pm - +91 6374 201 466: To know my knowledge.. being an extension BTech student staying in this hostel. I know the budget is equally given to every hostel. The ultimate power given to hostel secretaries, warden and hostel stuffs to keep any icecream night, barbeque night, festival events or hostel night. It depends on the secretaries and warden to decide when they want to keep such nights
15/08/22, 8:33 pm - +91 88594 08799: Don't say anything about Icecream party @ mahanadhi ... nothing is going to happen here .
15/08/22, 8:34 pm - +91 6374 201 466: I do feel even this hostel has enough budget to change the stuff which is broken or repaired or conducting the events mentioned above. It is all about our hostel secretaries to push things forward to make this happen.
That's the whole purpose of responsibility of hostel secretaries. Please do the needful secretaries.
15/08/22, 8:35 pm - +91 6374 201 466: Address it to HHS of our hostel. I think he can make this happen
15/08/22, 9:16 pm - +91 81458 31742: Actually in GBM warden sir told something related to extra fund also.
I mean as far I remember he told that if some fund required then I can manage it with CCW, he told something like this.
I'm not sure for what he told this, bcz at that time I was totally new students.
So I hope if we can request to warden sir,then maybe it possible.
15/08/22, 9:23 pm - +91 87635 65135: Someone pass ambulance num
15/08/22, 9:25 pm - +91 85418 58847: <Media omitted>
15/08/22, 9:26 pm - Pravas Pradhan: Bro five days before I have sent the exact message in this group and I have sent mail to ccw also. Nothing is there in this hostel. Totally neglected hostel among all. And there is no reaction from their side.
15/08/22, 9:26 pm - +91 85418 58847: Try the hospital number maybe
15/08/22, 9:27 pm - +91 70039 50664: I think some administrative people having allergy with the name of "Mahanadhi"  river🫣
15/08/22, 9:27 pm - +91 80876 92627: Yes. You have to call hospital. They will send it. Or approach security Mahanadhi. He will call.
15/08/22, 9:28 pm - +91 85418 58847: Here are the numbers

15/08/22, 9:58 pm - +91 79087 55490: Does anyone know why did they remove the water cooler in ground floor?
15/08/22, 9:59 pm - +91 87935 84232: Manager thought noone used it. That's what the guard told me.
15/08/22, 10:02 pm - +91 79087 55490: Wtf 👁️👄👁️
Is manager smoking nuts or grasses?
15/08/22, 10:11 pm - +91 79087 55490: Sorry Blowing nuts 💦💦

15/08/22, 10:49 pm - +91 98841 77994: When on earth we shall have our own ice cream night at Maha? 
I am too bored to visit other three hostels in their ice nt in last few months. Is there any hope for us -- kya hume vi icecream milega? 

#nation_wants_to_know!
15/08/22, 10:50 pm - +91 79087 55490: Nahi milega
15/08/22, 10:50 pm - +91 79087 55490: I am pretty sure
15/08/22, 10:50 pm - +91 79087 55490: Aesa manager hua toh kabhi nahi milega
15/08/22, 10:58 pm - +91 87084 74376: Chahiye bhi nahi 🤦🏼‍♂️
15/08/22, 11:07 pm - +91 85418 58847: Finally someone said this. Seconded 👍
15/08/22, 11:07 pm - +91 88882 36623: +1
15/08/22, 11:11 pm - +91 88853 66406: No fund brother. Waiting for next council only bcz then fund will activate to our hostel then they can do ice cream night n bbq night as well.
15/08/22, 11:12 pm - +91 98841 77994: Why no fund bro?
15/08/22, 11:12 pm - +91 98841 77994: Each hostel gets Est B fund on each sem. If it is not used it will go to ccw for their own use.
15/08/22, 11:13 pm - +91 98841 77994: Each hostel keep atleast 1 lakh for their Social sec budget. Why not for us?
15/08/22, 11:13 pm - +91 98841 77994: What went wrong here?
15/08/22, 11:14 pm - +91 98841 77994: Mahanadi council haven't done anything new which can lead to potential spending of huge est B amount
15/08/22, 11:15 pm - +91 80013 64764: Andolon hoga
15/08/22, 11:15 pm - +91 88594 08799: 💪
15/08/22, 11:17 pm - +91 80013 64764: Sab secretaries ko leke Google meet pe sabko bulao
15/08/22, 11:18 pm - +91 88853 66406: Everything consumed. Our hostel regulated by March brother. So that we got less amount than other hostel.
15/08/22, 11:18 pm - +91 99353 24729: Just make the data of fund received and amount spent available to the hostel resident.everyone can be at peace then
15/08/22, 11:18 pm - +91 98841 77994: Lest have a council meet with warden.
15/08/22, 11:20 pm - +91 88853 66406: Brother, did u attend GBM on that day?
15/08/22, 11:20 pm - +91 98841 77994: Suggestive
15/08/22, 11:22 pm - +91 98841 77994: You only give this same lame excuse for all our quarries. What make us obliged to attend your GBM or else we cant speak any word of truth?
15/08/22, 11:22 pm - +91 98309 40168: 💯
15/08/22, 11:22 pm - +91 98309 40168: Bulao
15/08/22, 11:24 pm - +91 95603 94281: Allocated budget that time like Liquid Soaps is not seemingly not used. Maybe you can clarify about how the budget has been exhausted
15/08/22, 11:26 pm - +91 88853 66406: Brother, here 1rs also not wasted. I can strongly believe it. Even though, we'll do it. Give some time brother. If we've fund then what would be the problem to me for celebrate that night. I'm also student like u.
15/08/22, 11:29 pm - +91 70039 50664: manager is the root cause of the problem, he doesnt want to involve in anything
15/08/22, 11:29 pm - +91 99353 24729: First thing, I am not blaming anyone . If transparency is there people won't be bothering you even.
15/08/22, 11:29 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly
15/08/22, 11:29 pm - +91 79087 55490: Now you guys think
Why I use to say everytime
15/08/22, 11:29 pm - +91 79087 55490: That manager should be here in this group
15/08/22, 11:30 pm - +91 79804 18220: Manager Mahanadhi.vcf (file attached)
15/08/22, 11:30 pm - +91 79087 55490: That time 
Everyone comes in personal chat to make me silent
15/08/22, 11:30 pm - +91 79804 18220: Add him admin
15/08/22, 11:30 pm - +91 79087 55490: Some of the secretaries and manager are solely responsible for the ill management of the hostel
15/08/22, 11:31 pm - +91 79087 55490: Ask the assistant warden
15/08/22, 11:31 pm - +91 98841 77994: Lets say we accept the willingness of the council. But, how long will it take? If rest of the hostels can do it well, why can't we get help and get along with them? It will surely reduce your pain to get quotes etc.
15/08/22, 11:31 pm - +91 70039 50664: sala aise hi guide dimag garam karke rakhta hain, uske bad ye sab ake dekhne ke bad lagta hain sab hostels chennai mein rehta hain and humlog lakshadeep mein rehte hain
15/08/22, 11:31 pm - +91 88853 66406: 100% transperancy brother. There is no corruption.
15/08/22, 11:33 pm - +91 98841 77994: None is questioning abt transparency. Its a general demand of right management of the funds that we all share and we deserve
15/08/22, 11:33 pm - +91 79087 55490: @918885366406 
If you want everything to be transparent, give a balance sheet of what has happened in this hostel from March to August 15.
15/08/22, 11:33 pm - +91 79087 55490: Within a week
15/08/22, 11:33 pm - +91 80790 59978: Guy's, please stop blaming to and individual person and secretaries, rather than complaining everyday. I think we need to do a serious meeting with respective secretaries and manager regat all these issues. Why all these issues are happening in our hostel only.
15/08/22, 11:33 pm - +91 89849 35693: We should not ask secretaries as they are also same like us, now let's meet with warden and ccw for all the funds related with establishment B
15/08/22, 11:33 pm - +91 79087 55490: And call everyone for a meeting
15/08/22, 11:34 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly
15/08/22, 11:34 pm - +91 79087 55490: +1
15/08/22, 11:35 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yes brother. Fund is the problem. Damn sure, next council will get the amount sufficiently. Then that secretary definitely will conduct everything. I'll discuss with the manager about all the matters. Give some time brothers.
15/08/22, 11:37 pm - +91 89849 35693: +1 yes by this reference it will be easy for everyone and awe will approach to ccw, BC they are taking money from our stipend😅
15/08/22, 11:38 pm - +91 98841 77994: Well, we can only wait now. But, I feel the way funds wete utilised, it could have been far better. 
Pls make the next council meet asap
15/08/22, 11:39 pm - +91 98841 77994: *were
15/08/22, 11:39 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yes, mukharjee. I've needed discussion with my council. We'll conduct a meeting soon. 👍🏻👍🏻 Please co-operate to us. This council everything done which was necessity to our hostel. I concentrated only on our hostel issues bcz quarantine time our hostel damaged totally. U might be know it.
15/08/22, 11:42 pm - +91 79087 55490: No @SANKAR
I really don't think our funds were utilized properly. I as a resident request you to provide the balance sheet of all the secretaries by 7 days.
15/08/22, 11:42 pm - +91 79087 55490: Then everyone will know where we have spent our funds
That will be a good lesson for everyone
15/08/22, 11:43 pm - +91 88853 66406: I never told about my transperancy how I am. Sincerely, everything done as a pre-planned what was our hostel needed to do it. We'll discuss in the meeting brothers. TQ to all
15/08/22, 11:43 pm - +91 79087 55490: Music Room is still pending. Fund was allocated for that as well
15/08/22, 11:43 pm - +91 79087 55490: What happened to that?
15/08/22, 11:43 pm - +91 80790 59978: Dear secretaries, i don't want any icecream night or DJ night, but please make sure that these lifts should working properly, always there is some issues wit the lifts, today also one lift is not working. Please find a permanent solution for that
15/08/22, 11:43 pm - +91 79087 55490: I need an answer for this as well. What happened to that?
15/08/22, 11:44 pm - +91 88853 66406: Sure Mukherjee. It is not big issue as of now i am thinking. But it have needed. TQ brother
15/08/22, 11:44 pm - +91 89849 35693: <Media omitted>

15/08/22, 11:47 pm - +91 89849 35693: <Media omitted>
15/08/22, 11:48 pm - +91 88853 66406: Mukherjee brother, fund allocated to everything. The thing is cost of thos instruments. We can't spend whole amount on onle one thing as music things. We've to spend on other issues also. I had answers for all queries. We'll discuss in the meeting only. I can't type all the things here🤪🤪 hand pain brother 😂😂
15/08/22, 11:49 pm - +91 79087 55490: You bring the balance sheet to my room 508. Then I will take your Oral 😂😂
Lol don't take it seriously
15/08/22, 11:49 pm - +91 79087 55490: But surely I want to see how the funds are spent
15/08/22, 11:49 pm - +91 89849 35693: You also understand we are breaking our heads only here since many months, so i don't think it's an important plateform 😟
15/08/22, 11:50 pm - +91 88853 66406: Nitish, i fought with the AEE for this issue. I told them about it very furious. I don't know what is the problem.
15/08/22, 11:51 pm - +91 79087 55490: Can you do one thing if I say?
15/08/22, 11:51 pm - +91 79087 55490: That will be really helpful for everyone
15/08/22, 11:51 pm - +91 88853 66406: Everything we'll discuss in the meeting. Let's rock the meeting soon. Waiting..... 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
15/08/22, 11:51 pm - +91 98841 77994: It might be your perception.

@918885366406 
Then have your coolness somewhere else.
15/08/22, 11:53 pm - +91 88853 66406: Tell me.
15/08/22, 11:53 pm - +91 79087 55490: Please add the manager ASAP. If you can't do this now, I am damn sure next council will also fail.
15/08/22, 11:53 pm - +91 79087 55490: I can write on paper with a red pen.
15/08/22, 11:54 pm - +91 88853 66406: Write it n submit in the office like CCW or DOST etc..
15/08/22, 11:55 pm - +91 79087 55490: Ask the assistant warden to do that. He is the admin of the group.
15/08/22, 11:55 pm - +91 79087 55490: Arrey @SANKAR
Every hostel manager should be in the group.
15/08/22, 11:55 pm - +91 88853 66406: No assistant warden to our hostel. He resigned due to his health issues.
15/08/22, 11:55 pm - +91 79087 55490: Then also I am ready to write
15/08/22, 11:56 pm - +91 79087 55490: For this I have to write a letter
Seriously
15/08/22, 11:57 pm - +91 88853 66406: I knew Mukherjee brother. This decision, i can't take by my own. Council has to decide about it. If he'll in the group, what would be the problem to me. I told already to him. Council will decide about it. I'm very happy if he'll be in the group personally. I'll ask him again
15/08/22, 11:57 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yeah. My support also with u as well. 👍🏻👍🏻
15/08/22, 11:57 pm - +91 79087 55490: You better take me along with you
15/08/22, 11:57 pm - +91 79087 55490: I will see how does he not comes to the group
15/08/22, 11:58 pm - +91 79087 55490: I understand your silence. You better take me if you are meeting manager. I will make him understand very nicely.
15/08/22, 11:59 pm - +91 88853 66406: No need with me. His office is in our hostel only. U can do brother.
15/08/22, 11:59 pm - +91 79087 55490: 🥺🥺🥺
15/08/22, 11:59 pm - +91 79087 55490: Have guts bro to say

16/08/22, 12:00 am - +91 88853 66406: No silence for anyone. I'm not devotees to anyone. I'm devotee to my guide only. I'm here to do my duty as a GS. Tq
16/08/22, 12:01 am - +91 79087 55490: Lol 😂

16/08/22, 7:55 am - +91 94860 87050: Social secretary budget ended way back in June itself. I have handed over the balance sheet to Manager in June. If anyone wants to go through it, they can visit hostel office and check.
16/08/22, 12:06 pm - +91 79087 55490: Okay
16/08/22, 6:08 pm - +91 80746 21056: Just me or the internet went off?

17/08/22, 4:03 pm - +91 80876 92627: Go to some other floor and come back again
17/08/22, 4:38 pm - +91 90608 77777: I wonder what if lift starts moving when the person is getting out of lift at this point
17/08/22, 4:45 pm - +91 70031 26090: Then we have to start praying to our respective god's 😅
17/08/22, 4:49 pm - +91 70251 40314: Still better than complaining to our Management...
17/08/22, 4:51 pm - +91 80790 59978: I think management's of this hostel taking us for granted. I complaint to the manager many times (highlighting  the severity  if lifts not work properly), but his statement was shocking....he said that, till now there was no serious incident happened in this lifts.  I also faced similar issues many times, sometimes lift door open without reaching the floor or one or two feel below or above the floor levels.
17/08/22, 4:51 pm - +91 70031 26090: Yup 😂
Atleast one of them might listen to our requests 😂
17/08/22, 4:55 pm - +91 90608 77777: Lets wait for some serious incident to happen..Maybe if someone can sacrifice for all of us.
17/08/22, 4:57 pm - +91 70251 40314: I think if we keep complaining they'll ban the lifts ...then everything will be solved ..

17/08/22, 5:51 pm - +91 97110 43649: This seems so much like their line of thought
17/08/22, 7:21 pm - +91 95855 71750: Where is the complaint book. When I asked the security for it, he reacted as if I asked his kidneys.
17/08/22, 7:21 pm - +91 97002 76503: Kindly contact manager for it.
17/08/22, 7:22 pm - +91 95855 71750: Hmm. Should they not investigate the corridors and bathrooms to see what's what. I would go to la  Or wait for the manager??
17/08/22, 7:23 pm - +91 95855 71750: Better keep the complaint book in the security table.
17/08/22, 7:23 pm - +91 97002 76503: U can request the same to manager his number is pasted on his room door
17/08/22, 7:24 pm - +91 95855 71750: Yes sir. I will do all. Let him sit and relax.
17/08/22, 7:25 pm - +91 95855 71750: They are suppose to monitor and investigate what are the issues and fix them.
17/08/22, 7:26 pm - +91 97002 76503: Is it possible in such a large hostel a person can check all the tubelight and electrical things ..come on man be practical...there is a problem let's raise a complain and resolve it..
17/08/22, 7:26 pm - +91 97002 76503: Just give him a call it's a small thing he will do the needful
17/08/22, 7:27 pm - +91 95855 71750: Ur really silly.. I am not saying them to check everyday. That's not necessary. These lights have been not working since a month. They can check once a month.
17/08/22, 7:27 pm - +91 95855 71750: Also not just the lights... About the way the washrooms are being cleaned and etc...
17/08/22, 7:28 pm - +91 95855 71750: They don't even care to clean the bathrooms... Just sweep the outside and are finished in like 10 minutes.
17/08/22, 7:28 pm - +91 97002 76503: See it's whose duty m no one to comment on that . .it's a problem if u need to solve just simply follow the procedure...or else just debate with anyone but not me..

17/08/22, 7:29 pm - +91 97002 76503: Why I will know m a research scholar...my duty is not to monitor that ...that's your keen and commendable observation...you can raise a complain....
17/08/22, 7:30 pm - +91 95855 71750: I am not debating with u. In fact u r debating with me. It's very clear.
17/08/22, 7:31 pm - +91 97002 76503: Clarity is what I have given contract the manger you are only telling so many things ..
17/08/22, 7:31 pm - +91 95855 71750: Y are u replying then. I just said if it's possible to keep the register on the security desk.
17/08/22, 7:31 pm - Vivek Ta: As I remember, you are one who wanted to discuss issues personally.

17/08/22, 7:33 pm - Vivek Ta: You encourage such system. And when the issue is something big, you just tell go and complain why you are telling me.
17/08/22, 7:33 pm - +91 97002 76503: Clearly this is not a group for complains...kindly raise them to the manger by phone or complain book...
17/08/22, 7:33 pm - +91 97002 76503: I don't even know who u are when did I said....

18/08/22, 12:14 pm - +91 85418 58847: If you go for beating, it wouldn’t remove the disorder. Plus, if he decides to approach the police, you’re gone
18/08/22, 12:15 pm - +91 81458 31742: 🙁🙁
18/08/22, 12:16 pm - +91 84313 34677: What if it never was a disorder. What if he is just a sadist?
18/08/22, 12:16 pm - +91 98608 52494: For some people this lock person have put a actually lock on the latch instead of locking  just a latch so I don’t think he is doing it out of ocd or fear or something
18/08/22, 12:16 pm - +91 84313 34677: Indeed.
18/08/22, 12:16 pm - +91 85418 58847: Still, therapy. Sadism isn’t a crime. Beating is
18/08/22, 12:18 pm - +91 98608 52494: Happened to me also once   From that point I m keeping my lock on the latch so that even if he locks it will be only latch thing and not actual lock with key .
18/08/22, 12:19 pm - +91 84313 34677: Bro. Baat ko kahi aur mat le jaa. Yaha baat ho rahi hai ek bande ka jo sabka rooms lock kar raha hai. Pakde toh maarenge karke bolenge gusse main. Par pakde toh pakka we will complain against that person to the respective authorities and get him punished. Ye police crime karke bahut bade bade baat bolke yaha ka mudda mat change kar. Tu bhala aadmi hai. Usko dhoondke permission poochke therapy dede.
18/08/22, 12:21 pm - +91 85418 58847: You can complain to the authorities even without finding the person actually. Actually this is the right way to go, not taking things into our own hands
18/08/22, 12:24 pm - +91 84313 34677: <Media omitted>
18/08/22, 12:38 pm - +91 98608 52494: Ek banda ya fir ek se jada log bhi ho sakta he.   But how can we find the culprit/culprits   Uska koi idea nahi he.
18/08/22, 12:38 pm - +91 85418 58847: You yourself just pointed out a complication. 

This is what I am saying. Things in life aren’t always as simple as they appear
18/08/22, 12:40 pm - +91 84313 34677: Ye hota hai solution dhoondne ke taraf badhna.
18/08/22, 12:40 pm - +91 84313 34677: Aur ye hota hai baat ko ghumana.
18/08/22, 12:41 pm - +91 84313 34677: Theek se padh bhai. Complication kaha hai. Life simple hai. Tu complicate kar raha hai therapy bolke🤦🏻‍♂️
18/08/22, 12:42 pm - +91 84313 34677: Abhi ye socho ki usko pakadna kaise hai. Baad main sochenge ki therapy dena hai ki nahi
18/08/22, 12:43 pm - +91 85418 58847: Fine. It’s your call. Do what you think is right. Let’s see how far it gets you 🤷🏻‍♂️
18/08/22, 12:44 pm - +91 84313 34677: It should just get me in and out of my room without a moron locking it! Utna kaafi hai. Mujhe usse aage jaana hi nahi hai.
18/08/22, 12:46 pm - +91 84313 34677: I never heard that open doors cause phobia. And locking doors from outside is a disorder of some kind.
18/08/22, 12:46 pm - +91 87084 74376: I feel that he is the guy
18/08/22, 12:47 pm - +91 87084 74376: The way he is saying things 😂😂😂😂
18/08/22, 12:47 pm - +91 87084 74376: Locking doors ocds
18/08/22, 12:47 pm - +91 84313 34677: If that’s the case, how come he is living in an institute where he sees open doors all the time? Bhai, washroom ki bhi kundi khuli hoti hai. Kabhi tujhe hi andar band kar dia toh?
18/08/22, 12:47 pm - +91 84313 34677: Mujhe bhi aise hi lag raha hai. Bhai abhi bolde therapy chahiye kya?
18/08/22, 12:47 pm - +91 85418 58847: Yes, but there are many rare diseases about which you haven’t heard. Doesn’t mean they don’t exist
18/08/22, 12:47 pm - +91 84313 34677: Aisa kuch rog hai kya?
18/08/22, 12:48 pm - +91 87084 74376: Bhai ko hi pata hai yar
18/08/22, 12:49 pm - +91 85418 58847: Phobias develop from past experiences. Humans can have phobia of almost anything they have a bad experience with
18/08/22, 12:50 pm - +91 84313 34677: Oh accha. Phir toh jaankari dijiye ki aisa kaunsa rog hai jo doosro ko room main band kare. Ghar main bhi aisahi karta hoga banda
18/08/22, 12:50 pm - Vivek Ta: You guys keep the lock outside, while your are in the room??
18/08/22, 12:50 pm - +91 98608 52494: OCD ya fear he toh apne room ke as pas ya fir ek floor pe hi lock hona chahiye.   Alag alag floor pe jake lock karna ajeeb he.  He is just enjoying mild suffering of others
18/08/22, 12:51 pm - +91 84313 34677: Internet main mil jaata hai ye sentence. Mujhe ye batao ki khule hue kundi ka rog kya hai ye
18/08/22, 12:51 pm - +91 84313 34677: Indeed. Aisa hi mera bhi soch hai
18/08/22, 12:52 pm - +91 85418 58847: He may be a sadist. But so far, he has not done any crime which is punishable
18/08/22, 12:52 pm - Vivek Ta: Did anyone complain about this to the hostel security or manager??
18/08/22, 12:53 pm - +91 98608 52494: Yes I went and talked to manager. But manager said sare floors pe camera nahi laga sakte
18/08/22, 12:53 pm - Vivek Ta: Did he lock the room with a person inside??
18/08/22, 12:53 pm - +91 84313 34677: Tu hi soch ki tujhe kahi jaana hai aur kisine tujhe lock kardia. Security ko aane main der hogi aur tere dost bhi nahi hai hostel main. Tere muh se gaali niklega ki tu ye sochega ki usko pakadke therapy denge?
18/08/22, 12:53 pm - +91 84313 34677: Toh atleast uspe lagao jaha pe zyada hota hai
18/08/22, 12:54 pm - +91 98608 52494: But still he needs to be stopped.  And we need to find him.   And I agree we shouldn’t beat him or anything but he deserves some punishment.
18/08/22, 12:55 pm - +91 84313 34677: Toh hum uska wait kare ya abhi usko theek kare?
18/08/22, 12:55 pm - +91 98608 52494: Almost har floor pe horaha he
18/08/22, 12:55 pm - +91 84313 34677: Ye manager kuch bhi kaam bole toh reason de deta hai.
18/08/22, 12:56 pm - +91 85418 58847: Yes, it needs to be stopped obviously. But they are talking about violence, which is a crime, in response to something which isn’t a crime but just an inconvenience
18/08/22, 12:56 pm - +91 98608 52494: I m not 100 percent sure on this.  But this is happening to the rooms which are near to floor exits like lifts and staircases
18/08/22, 12:57 pm - +91 98608 52494: Yeah punishment should be decided by authorities and not us.   We should just try and find him
18/08/22, 12:57 pm - +91 84313 34677: Haan pehle dhoondo baad main sochte hai. Yahi toh bol rahe hai
18/08/22, 1:08 pm - +91 87084 74376: Are gnadhi bhagat tham ja yar
18/08/22, 1:08 pm - +91 87084 74376: 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
18/08/22, 1:17 pm - +91 84313 34677: Bhai itna hi non violence karna hai toh pehle non violence ka matlab samajh ke aaja. Non violence ka hindi main matlab hai ahimsa. Kisiko himsa na karna. Inconvenience caused by one person to other is also himsa. That person may not be committing crime according to the norms of our society but woh himsa toh kar raha hai doosron ka.

18/08/22, 1:57 pm - +91 84313 34677: I implied not to do it deliberately
18/08/22, 1:57 pm - +91 84313 34677: Locking doors does not occur unintentionally

18/08/22, 9:43 pm - +91 77080 72829: I agree. He is switched off power switch also when locking. So high chance that he is just seeking thrill in others suffering

19/08/22, 8:22 pm - +91 77298 52387: !!Please collect the clothes which I kept in my bucket near rr5.
20/08/22, 8:49 am - +91 84313 34677: Please instruct them to do it on all floors. Fogging ground floor alone will drive the mosquitoes to top floors
20/08/22, 9:16 am - +91 91106 82101: +1
20/08/22, 9:25 am - +91 97486 72248: My mom wasn't permitted to visit my hostel room in Mahanadhi.. Where in Pampa , my friend's mom was allowed to visit his room. Any ideas on why this difference?
20/08/22, 9:26 am - +91 79087 55490: Why so?
20/08/22, 9:26 am - +91 79087 55490: Whereas Girls are allowed inside the hostel 
And our Moms are not allowed in the Hostels.
20/08/22, 9:26 am - +91 97486 72248: Exactly my point.
20/08/22, 9:28 am - +91 97486 72248: Again, at least Pampa people are able to do so of not others too 🤧. So we are at the losing end here 😪
20/08/22, 9:29 am - +91 79804 18220: That morning time from 6am to 2pm security is not a good man, I felt while going to home. He behaves as if he is the main authority.
20/08/22, 9:29 am - +91 79087 55490: Like I don't get it
20/08/22, 9:29 am - +91 79804 18220: If possible bro, you can book a room in taramani guest house in the campus for your parents from ccw website
20/08/22, 9:30 am - +91 80053 64128: This message was deleted
20/08/22, 9:30 am - +91 97486 72248: Yeah I would from next time. But still..this is an issue that needs to be resolved.
20/08/22, 9:32 am - +91 80053 64128: Technically, any outsider is not allowed to enter inside hostel not even parents. Girls that are allowed are students that's why they are allowed. This is what in the rule book.
20/08/22, 9:32 am - +91 79804 18220: Yeah, that's need to be discussed with manager.Moreover @917908755490 's  point is genuine.
20/08/22, 9:32 am - +91 97486 72248: Yep true.
20/08/22, 9:33 am - +91 97486 72248: Umm.. Then every hostel should maintain it. But apparently our hostel is the only one *STRICT ENOUGH* to maintain it
20/08/22, 9:33 am - +91 79804 18220: We all know what girls come and do here
20/08/22, 9:33 am - +91 80053 64128: That's a different point all together 😂
20/08/22, 9:33 am - +91 79087 55490: There are n number of people coming inside the hostel with adhaar card also.
20/08/22, 9:33 am - +91 84313 34677: Technically I have been in this hostel since Jan 2020. My parents visited me, came to my room and were here for more than an hour. They just had to give an id proof to the security. That is all. I don’t know why parents are not being allowed in. These rules are absurd
20/08/22, 9:34 am - +91 97486 72248: This is one fabulous hostel here... No bbq or icecream nights, weirdly strict rules and what not
20/08/22, 9:34 am - +91 79087 55490: Exactly
20/08/22, 9:34 am - +91 80053 64128: Bt yes, keeping everything appart. Parents should be allowed as it's morally incorrect that's my take on it.
20/08/22, 9:34 am - +91 84313 34677: Yeah.
20/08/22, 9:38 am - +91 91106 82101: <Media omitted>
20/08/22, 9:38 am - +91 70251 40314: My mom was allowed to come to my room last week.
20/08/22, 9:38 am - +91 91106 82101: We aren't allowed to bring parents or others as guests (visitors who will be boarding in the hostel for a period of time)
20/08/22, 9:39 am - +91 80053 64128: Ohh...then why did the guard stopped? On what basis😅
20/08/22, 9:39 am - +91 84313 34677: Well, everything is clear now. The security person at that time did not follow the protocol, broke the rule set by institute and caused an inconvenience to one of the residents of hostel. We should complain.
20/08/22, 9:40 am - +91 79087 55490: This message was deleted
20/08/22, 9:41 am - +91 79087 55490: Exactly please complain in the notebook 
Otherwise the silly and cheeky heads won't get it.
20/08/22, 9:44 am - +91 81458 31742: 3 am!!! Really
20/08/22, 9:44 am - +91 81458 31742: 🧐🧐
20/08/22, 9:44 am - +91 79087 55490: Yes
20/08/22, 9:46 am - +91 79087 55490: Next time if I am facing any inconvenience regarding this, I will complain in the complain book with your room number and roll number mentioned. Then you have to look for some other place. 
Note: Couples can do whatever they want but within limits.
20/08/22, 9:51 am - +91 87084 74376: That can be a boy with long hairs maybe
20/08/22, 9:51 am - +91 87084 74376: It's hard to differentiate these days
20/08/22, 9:51 am - +91 97486 72248: Same thing I will do
20/08/22, 9:51 am - +91 87084 74376: 😂
20/08/22, 9:52 am - +91 87084 74376: Plus it was 3 am
20/08/22, 9:52 am - +91 87084 74376: Maybe you saw someone else
20/08/22, 9:53 am - +91 79804 18220: As it was shown in 83 movie?
20/08/22, 9:54 am - +91 97486 72248: For now the problem is solved.
20/08/22, 9:54 am - +91 79087 55490: Lol 😂😂😂
It was a girl itself
Men and women have different anatomy.
20/08/22, 9:54 am - +91 97486 72248: Next time if it happens, gonna raise a complaint
20/08/22, 9:57 am - +91 80876 92627: This message was deleted
20/08/22, 11:15 am - +91 90823 99226: RR16 please remove the cloths from the machine.
20/08/22, 11:15 am - +91 90823 99226: There is no bucket kept around
20/08/22, 11:17 am - +91 97002 76503: Parents are allowed.But not to stay over night.But if u do booking via ikollege male parent can stay..I think 300 per day..

20/08/22, 11:21 am - +91 97002 76503: Actually that guard is like that..
20/08/22, 11:29 am - +91 97486 72248: Hm
20/08/22, 12:05 pm - +91 88594 08799: Yes
20/08/22, 12:05 pm - +91 88594 08799: That old man right?
20/08/22, 12:06 pm - +91 88594 08799: His behaviour is always rude
20/08/22, 12:07 pm - +91 88853 66406: We informed to him. It won't repeat.
20/08/22, 12:14 pm - Vivek Ta: Many local rules are not same across hostels. I feel that we have very restricted rules and budgets considering the usage of the hostel. Regarding hostel specific rules, warden is the ultimate authority.
20/08/22, 12:16 pm - Vivek Ta: What is current rule for visitors(other hostel students/parents/outside friends) in Mahanadhi hostel as of now??
20/08/22, 12:18 pm - +91 98842 99098: There are no such local rules. All the hostels should follow institute rules book.
20/08/22, 12:19 pm - +91 79804 18220: Yes
20/08/22, 12:19 pm - +91 70251 40314: This should be the case...
20/08/22, 12:20 pm - +91 98842 99098: I feel the security is doing his duty. If security is strict then only hostel mates are safe. He may have done due to his ignorance. Better we can paste vistor rules at the hostel entrance.
20/08/22, 12:20 pm - Vivek Ta: Is this your opinion or you know that there is no difference???🤔🤔
20/08/22, 12:22 pm - +91 98842 99098: The security had to implement iit rules which are common to all hostels. There are no local rules specific to each hostel.
20/08/22, 12:23 pm - Vivek Ta: Hostel secretaries can confirm this.
20/08/22, 12:24 pm - Vivek Ta: Let's see what the secretaries has to tell??
20/08/22, 12:24 pm - Vivek Ta: *have
20/08/22, 12:29 pm - +91 80876 92627: *DO NOT USE WASHING MACHINE NEAR RR23*

The drain pipe is clogged and the water is coming out from all possible outlets. The wash basin area and 2 bathrooms are full of water. 

I have raised complaint few days back in the register but it wasn’t appropriately addressed apparently. 

Now I have informed security to send someone and I hope the action is taken. 

*Till then DO NOT USE THE MACHINE NEAR RR23* 

Else water will start flowing out of the restrooms.
20/08/22, 12:31 pm - +91 88224 11339: Exit time 9 PM
20/08/22, 12:32 pm - +91 97486 72248: That is true.
20/08/22, 12:33 pm - +91 79087 55490: Mail Warden Sir
He has proclaimed that if nothing is done mail him immediately. He will take care of it.

20/08/22, 11:55 pm - +91 84394 30391: Do you know why the water cooler from ground floor has been removed @918885366406 
That used to be there in pre covid times as well.
It should be reinstalled as soon as possible. Please look into it.
21/08/22, 12:09 am - +91 79087 55490: I was also asking the same question.

Why wasnt it added ?
21/08/22, 10:52 am - +91 96741 12479: That's not my solution!! That's what Warden sir thinks!! Some irresponsible folks made it happen!!
21/08/22, 10:52 am - +91 90608 77777: We dont have 

And the old chess sets are missing too.
If we start losing the old things like this, the budget will keep on increasing all the time

21/08/22, 10:55 am - +91 96741 12479: In GBM if more people agree on it I would do that!!
21/08/22, 10:55 am - +91 96741 12479: Yeah security was saying to put a lock!!
21/08/22, 10:55 am - +91 90608 77777: Even the valid warranty cards for washing machines and refrigerator...they were not stored
21/08/22, 10:56 am - +91 96741 12479: Also some had taken sindhu hostel's cricket bat and kept it here for more than a month!!
21/08/22, 10:56 am - +91 96741 12479: *someone
21/08/22, 10:56 am - +91 91567 16710: When is that?
21/08/22, 10:57 am - +91 96741 12479: I guess in September!!
21/08/22, 10:58 am - +91 90608 77777: Then possibly our chess sets must be in other hostel
21/08/22, 10:59 am - +91 96741 12479: Could be!!
21/08/22, 11:00 am - +91 90608 77777: I wouldnt say it is your mistake

but someone should take the responsibility for this
21/08/22, 11:00 am - +91 91567 16710: Seems like Warden and manager are the only people who having best time of there lives
21/08/22, 11:01 am - +91 91106 82101: Does the reading room have lan connection?
21/08/22, 11:02 am - +91 90608 77777: There used to be🫥
21/08/22, 11:02 am - +91 96741 12479: If students take things and don't return what can be done!!
21/08/22, 11:02 am - +91 91106 82101: 🤦‍♂
21/08/22, 11:02 am - +91 87547 16503: Does we want to submit RTPCR for 4 days leave in hostel?
21/08/22, 11:03 am - +91 90608 77777: its not students
21/08/22, 11:04 am - +91 90608 77777: they were not there even before we were reallocated here
possibly, during the covid time, they were stolen
21/08/22, 11:05 am - +91 90608 77777: And if students didny return
still it is management's mistake..Dont you agree ?
21/08/22, 11:07 am - +91 90608 77777: Atleast we need to make a list of all the things that were there before
21/08/22, 11:09 am - +91 96741 12479: So who took??
21/08/22, 11:10 am - +91 96741 12479: Well then the security has to be very strict and students don't like that!!
21/08/22, 11:10 am - +91 96741 12479: Yeah that's very essential!!
21/08/22, 11:11 am - +91 90608 77777: you are talking about present situation
21/08/22, 11:12 am - +91 90608 77777: Noting down names for anything taken from the sports room

How does it imply security is strict ?
21/08/22, 11:12 am - Vivek Ta: I have raised this concern long back. But secretary(ies) was(were) not ready to take it up. The concern was that when the students/scholars returned to hostels after CoViD, did all the hostels had the same facilities (or atleast comparable). Mainly, the facilities in hostels handed over to Corporation for CoViD purposes were either intensionally removed by administration or damaged by the public usage. And such hostels need to put their funds in refurbishing those basic amenities which were removed and damaged.
21/08/22, 11:13 am - +91 96741 12479: It is there na!! People write down whatever they take!!
21/08/22, 11:14 am - +91 96741 12479: What's your solution??
21/08/22, 11:14 am - +91 90608 77777: If so, then why are they missing ?
21/08/22, 11:15 am - +91 90608 77777: This atleast...
I believe you even did send a draft mail to the secretaries so as to forward to ccw
21/08/22, 11:15 am - Vivek Ta: I m curious to know how 'Tamiraparani' hostel is handling their issues, as they were also one of hostels handed over to Corporation during CoViD times.
21/08/22, 11:15 am - +91 91567 16710: Through effective management.
21/08/22, 11:16 am - Vivek Ta: I m dealing with different issues now. Can't afford to send more mails as of now. Will surely send required mails once my previous issues are cleared 👍
21/08/22, 11:18 am - Vivek Ta: List of all such facilities that were available should be noted in my opinion.
21/08/22, 11:21 am - Vivek Ta: Such vague statements can dilute your arguments.

21/08/22, 11:26 am - +91 91567 16710: Please add manager and warden sir in this group...why are sec should go through all questions.

21/08/22, 11:33 am - +91 88594 08799: take clothes from rr-15 washing machine
21/08/22, 12:01 pm - +91 84394 30391: There used to be a router in pre covid days , it is missing now , there used to be a printer as well. 
I request the lit sec to ensure that the facilities are restored.
21/08/22, 12:06 pm - +91 84394 30391: That should be done and we need the accountability from manager sir regarding things that are not restored.
I think people who joined before covid can collaborate to come up with a list of all such facilities
21/08/22, 12:07 pm - +91 84394 30391: Kudos to @919060877777  for taking this initiative
21/08/22, 3:53 pm - +91 97110 43649: Whoever is using unconfigured router kindly configure it, it's taking 2 min to even download a 2 mb pdf
21/08/22, 4:29 pm - +91 89470 69850: Let's form a group for each floor and check each and every room
21/08/22, 4:29 pm - +91 89470 69850: For the routers
21/08/22, 4:29 pm - +91 89470 69850: 4 guys for each floor
21/08/22, 4:34 pm - +91 77619 54477: Hey, what exactly do you guys mean by this configuration? From a curiosity perspective, can you please share some link/info about this.
21/08/22, 4:35 pm - +91 77619 54477: Unable to understand how a router setting should impact the nodes from the switch/gateway.
21/08/22, 4:42 pm - +91 85115 65232: 😵
21/08/22, 5:09 pm - +91 80053 64128: It does impact the internet connection. Previously I also used to think that router do not effect the internet and it's just something wrong in the network connections of our hostel. But it turns out, unconfigured router plays a huge role in disrupting the network of the whole hostel (specially those whoes distance is nearer to the router; node wise). In brief it floods it's own packet in the network which creates rukus and sometimes no internet at all.
21/08/22, 5:19 pm - +91 77619 54477: Thanks. So what is this configuration? The only thing I can think of is if anyone is configuring static IP that clashes with someone else's. But then that should not affect the entire hostel. Didn't get the flooding argument as well. Can discuss it with you in person if you're up for it.
21/08/22, 5:23 pm - +91 98842 99098: Guys, jio network signals are not at all reaching inner wing of 3rd floor. Anyone comment on the Airtel signal strength in the inner wing?
21/08/22, 5:28 pm - +91 82729 09591: 2nd floor... Airtel and Vodafone working fine
21/08/22, 5:31 pm - +91 80053 64128: Some configuration pdf was shared I guess. Anyone here who has that pdf pls share it once again.
21/08/22, 5:37 pm - +91 80053 64128: If you are configuring using static IP basically means your router will have one ip and if that ip is somehow lost or taken back from the router, then router won't provide net. (I was just giving explanation of what static ip means to those who might know it). But the problem is bit different. When someone asks ip for the first time, it broadcast a packet to know it's ip. The catch is as this router is nearby, it will send it's own local ip instead of you getting the ip resolved from college dhcp server. Hence there can be a loop like this which may lead to no internet. Second point is that every network has a limit just like number of vehicles that can pass through in a road at a given point of time. This router also starts flooding it's own packets which creates congestion in the network. This flooding part is bit sketch for me too, so i will ping you directly if i look into this flooding part as well as what packets actually cause congestion.
21/08/22, 5:45 pm - +91 90087 72337: <Media omitted>
21/08/22, 6:00 pm - +91 77619 54477: Thanks man. So it seems some router is assigning IPs to devices. This mean those devices are all going through it. This may end up in congestion among devices connected to that router as it's bandwidth would be limited. 

If I understand it correctly, this would still not impact all floors, as each floor has a separate switch. Unless there is such a router on all floors. 

To understand the situation this I am sharing a Google form. Please mention your floor and internet speed. It would help us locate the problem. Will share the results from the form by midnight.
21/08/22, 6:01 pm - +91 98842 99098: Thank you Paul.
21/08/22, 6:05 pm - +91 98480 95257: So DHCP server should be disabled right?
21/08/22, 6:05 pm - +91 80053 64128: Yes.
21/08/22, 6:06 pm - +91 77619 54477: https://forms.gle/YSj51KpiLf2Q2Yoy6
21/08/22, 6:08 pm - +91 98480 95257: I think the problem is if people don't enable DHCP server they won't be able to connect to their router because you have to give manual IP assignment to each device and many don't know how to do it
21/08/22, 6:09 pm - +91 77619 54477: Guys, please fill this form with your internet and floor. We can reach a solution better this way. 

Checked with folks with other hostels, they are also facing the same issue. Last I checked, the tower hostels had a common gateway. So the issue might not be clear.
21/08/22, 6:18 pm - +91 98480 95257: It's better if the institute puts some routers/repeaters in each hostel floor. So people don't have to put their own routers and mess up the whole network. Because we don't mobile signals also properly in these hostels so atleast wifi calling can be enabled.
21/08/22, 6:33 pm - +91 80053 64128: No no it's not like that. When you connect to the router, when DHCP disabled, it works as repeater. So you need not to worry about ip assignment. It will work flawlessly. It's just you have to login using ldap with all the devices you connect to router.
21/08/22, 6:43 pm - +91 98480 95257: Ohh okay 👍

21/08/22, 10:06 pm - +91 85418 58847: The slow network must be due to a shielding effect provided by the walls. I don’t know how complaining about it can help

23/08/22, 12:39 pm - +91 84394 30391: I discussed about the issue with  water cooler on ground floor with manager sir. He pointed out 3 things -
1) People using kitchen use water cooler to wash off hands and at times some smaller utensils as well that leads to accumulation of food particles in sink making  it dirty.

2) The socket used for water cooler is used by iron so even if water cooler is placed there people who need to use iron will remove the plug and use it for ironing . So we need to get a new socket particularly for water cooler that has to done through a process of approvals and all. 

3) People use is carelessly and at times open the lid of water cooler and he said he has seen some insects that fell in the tank while the lid was open.

That's it, someone mentioned that it was removed because people font use it. That was not brought up by manager sir  when he  was talking to me.

To sum up 2 things need to be done - 
#Get a separate socket for it 
#Proper usage by hostel mates
23/08/22, 1:07 pm - +91 83018 85364: Now there is no water cooler in ground floor. The water dispenser is not working properly (only normal water is coming?

30/08/22, 11:21 am - +91 89470 69850: We should ask for hostel election

30/08/22, 11:21 am - +91 80876 92627: Not manager. Time to call warden and take his help

30/08/22, 11:23 am - +91 89470 69850: We should also do that
30/08/22, 11:23 am - +91 89470 69850: As we never had any elections for hostel positions
30/08/22, 11:36 am - +91 88853 66406: RO plant problem. Already I mentioned. We can't do anything. Some water cans are in the ground floor.
30/08/22, 11:37 am - +91 85115 65232: We can always order the cans in emergency no ??

30/08/22, 11:42 am - +91 80876 92627: There should be alternate option. Please contact warden immediately on our behalf.

30/08/22, 12:12 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly who is doing that 😂
30/08/22, 12:14 pm - +91 92685 92880: Please I request everyone  it creates a disturbance and if we mute the group, we will miss important information regarding the hostel
30/08/22, 12:18 pm - +91 99446 86190: +1

It seems like secretaries go to RO plant do repair like that. Is it good? We're also living in the same hostel n facing same issues as well. We're doing our level best. If u can understand then happy.
30/08/22, 12:24 pm - +91 81458 31742: Some of guys didn't bother to read the message also..... just wake up and ask something

30/08/22, 5:02 pm - +91 99780 73246: Rr19, pls dont throw chopped onion in washbasin... it stucked. Whoever did this pls take care of next time.
30/08/22, 6:46 pm - +91 81458 31742: Can I complain about lift directly to the warden?
( with cc hostel sectery )
30/08/22, 6:49 pm - +91 81458 31742: Today just I escape from getting badly hurted.
Both the Inside Door was open fully, but only one out side door was open.
I thought I can leave from that half part.
But suddenly like in bullet speed it stopped when I just about to leave..... If suddenly I put my hand in between door, then surely my wrist bone will got fracture. 
( I believe those who are staying in 4th floor 540 ranges room,they might hear the sound)
30/08/22, 6:52 pm - +91 73505 60129: Yes ,this is so serious issue.everyone should take note and take necessary action .I had also same issue .😥😥
30/08/22, 6:52 pm - +91 73505 60129: Please
30/08/22, 6:52 pm - +91 73505 60129: Do something 
Seniors
30/08/22, 6:52 pm - +91 73505 60129: 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
30/08/22, 6:52 pm - +91 73505 60129: I am new here ...
30/08/22, 6:54 pm - +91 95535 34691: You will learn by experience. That’s life 😁
30/08/22, 6:56 pm - +91 80876 92627: You can demand a GBM with Warden. Let’s discuss all the issues in hostel
30/08/22, 7:03 pm - +91 73505 60129: For testing experience life should exist for that...
30/08/22, 7:04 pm - +91 73505 60129: You might not be aware about speed of door closing...
30/08/22, 7:04 pm - +91 73505 60129: It may be mach 2
30/08/22, 7:04 pm - +91 73505 60129: 😅
30/08/22, 7:07 pm - +91 81458 31742: Seriously bro,
Even I tried twice for opening the door....same response same speed.
30/08/22, 7:08 pm - +91 81458 31742: If both the door isn't opening that's still Okey,
But here half was open,so most of person will think of getting out from it.
But if they do so.....immediately they have to go hospital.
30/08/22, 7:10 pm - +91 85115 65232: 🤣🤣
30/08/22, 7:11 pm - +91 81458 31742: Yes, we should do that.
And last time GBM very less guys were there.....
So in my opinion before GBM one Google sheet can be created, those who have serious complaint regarding hostel, we can note it down.
Else in 30 min meeting half of the issue will not be Rais
30/08/22, 7:12 pm - +91 99693 94156: Less guys were there in GBM because it was kept during general working hrs

Else most of the PPL were ready to come I believe
30/08/22, 7:14 pm - +91 81458 31742: Yes it's might be the reason.
30/08/22, 7:37 pm - +91 88855 00157: Anyone has an iron box? It's urgent . Will give it back in 15 mins.
30/08/22, 7:41 pm - +91 96236 44088: Stuck in lift for atleast 4 times so far

30/08/22, 9:07 pm - +91 77080 72829: The water is salty. Not what it used to be. Mayb the RO isn't fixed yet. Nevertheless, they are supplying it in cans.

03/09/22, 9:12 pm - +91 97906 49372: Yes
03/09/22, 10:34 pm - +91 79087 55490: The water which is given to us right now tastes bizarre
03/09/22, 10:34 pm - +91 84313 34677: I also got throat pain drinking that water. I stopped drinking water in hostel.
03/09/22, 10:40 pm - +91 77080 72829: Yes. For me too. It tastes like tap water
03/09/22, 10:41 pm - +91 89470 69850: It is tap water
03/09/22, 10:42 pm - +91 77080 72829: <Media omitted>
03/09/22, 10:45 pm - +91 85418 58847: I don't think so
03/09/22, 10:46 pm - +91 81080 47688: Yeah it tastes different
03/09/22, 10:46 pm - +91 80013 64764: +1
03/09/22, 10:48 pm - +91 85418 58847: No, because the TDS (total dissolved solids) of tap water here is about 250 but the TDS of drinking water supplied is about 130, which puts it in the excellent to drink category
03/09/22, 10:48 pm - +91 80013 64764: <Media omitted>
03/09/22, 10:49 pm - +91 85418 58847: No, I actually checked after they started supply again
03/09/22, 10:49 pm - +91 79087 55490: But it is tasting very different from previous
03/09/22, 10:50 pm - +91 85418 58847: Yeah, it does, but it's not bad water
03/09/22, 10:50 pm - +91 85418 58847: Maybe after repairing they altered the TDS which would change taste
03/09/22, 10:51 pm - +91 84313 34677: How do you explain me getting throat pain and becoming alright as soon as I stopped drinking water in hostel
03/09/22, 10:51 pm - +91 85418 58847: I can't say anything about without more info
03/09/22, 10:52 pm - +91 84313 34677: I can because I have more info about my day than you.
03/09/22, 10:53 pm - +91 85418 58847: I mean there could be whole lot of factors
03/09/22, 10:54 pm - +91 84313 34677: I have ruled out all factors as I did not eat or drink anything else from outside.
03/09/22, 10:54 pm - +91 85418 58847: But the water isn't bad. Maybe it has some particular compound you are allergic to or something. I can't say anything about that
03/09/22, 10:54 pm - +91 85115 65232: 😅😅
03/09/22, 10:55 pm - +91 84313 34677: Hey I remember you. I think you were the one who suggested therapy to the person who locks the doors from outside if I’m not wrong🤔
03/09/22, 10:56 pm - +91 85115 65232: I agree with you on the TDS thing ... Other things not sure
03/09/22, 10:56 pm - +91 85418 58847: I was. That has got nothing to do with this though
03/09/22, 10:56 pm - +91 85115 65232: Yes
03/09/22, 10:56 pm - +91 94971 53893: Me too
03/09/22, 10:57 pm - +91 85115 65232: Macha you ok, now ??
03/09/22, 10:57 pm - +91 85115 65232: We have a test on Monday take care 🤣
03/09/22, 10:57 pm - +91 94971 53893: I don't know where it's the water or not, but having throat problem from today
03/09/22, 10:58 pm - +91 94971 53893: 😂😂✌🏻
03/09/22, 10:58 pm - +91 85115 65232: 😛😛
03/09/22, 10:58 pm - +91 84313 34677: No. But it has got everything to know how u think😋. U are correct and every other person suffering due to “LOW TDS GOOD QUALITY FRESH DRINKING WATER” supplied in this hostel is wrong!😃
03/09/22, 10:58 pm - +91 97110 43649: Yea
03/09/22, 10:59 pm - +91 85115 65232: Agreed
03/09/22, 10:59 pm - +91 85115 65232: Can we complaint somewhere ??
03/09/22, 10:59 pm - +91 94971 53893: But if others are also having it, then there must be a common cause
03/09/22, 10:59 pm - +91 84313 34677: We should.
03/09/22, 10:59 pm - +91 84313 34677: Yeah!
03/09/22, 11:00 pm - +91 97110 43649: No idea bro till now no complain has had any effect
03/09/22, 11:00 pm - +91 85418 58847: I believe the reading I saw on my instrument. I have a slight liver inflammation so I wouldn't be drinking it if I wasn't completely sure
03/09/22, 11:00 pm - +91 77080 72829: Chennai's ground water can't b trusted. Hav u smelled the adayar river? It's pure sewage. It is FAR away from the mineral rich mountain water , which is said to b healther.
03/09/22, 11:01 pm - +91 77080 72829: So it's better off drinking low TDS water. Especially in chennai
03/09/22, 11:01 pm - +91 84313 34677: Yes. You are right!
03/09/22, 11:02 pm - +91 84313 34677: So stay with the good when u were previously getting better?🧐. I’m sorry but that logic just went over my head!
03/09/22, 11:04 pm - +91 77080 72829: Let me b clear.... Water now is bad. Water before was good
03/09/22, 11:05 pm - +91 84313 34677: Yes. So u are insisting on getting good water like before? I’m sorry I might have mistaken
03/09/22, 11:05 pm - +91 77080 72829: Yeah. 🤗 it's ok bro
03/09/22, 11:06 pm - +91 84313 34677: Then it would be better if we complain
03/09/22, 11:06 pm - +91 97110 43649: Is this issue only with this hostel Or with other hostels too?
03/09/22, 11:07 pm - +91 77080 72829: +1
03/09/22, 11:18 pm - +91 85418 58847: <Media omitted>
03/09/22, 11:18 pm - +91 85418 58847: <Media omitted>
03/09/22, 11:18 pm - +91 85418 58847: Based on this, you can decide
03/09/22, 11:19 pm - +91 84313 34677: Thanks. You are right.
03/09/22, 11:21 pm - +91 85418 58847: You can be sarcastic if you want but you should remember that the authorities will probably ask you the same question
03/09/22, 11:26 pm - +91 84313 34677: Bro I’m agreeing with you and the values you sent. But we cannot just see the values right. What does TDS give? TDS gives total dissolved solids. Doesn’t tell which solids. What if those solids are harmful. Even for u, as u said u have liver inflammation. I’m not being sarcastic. You are just being difficult. When most of the people in hostel agree to something you always have something opposite to say. When people are telling they are getting throat pain from a few days that means something is wrong in the thing which is common for all of us. Which is water. But u tell this water is fine means u don’t want to listen to other people’s concerns and u wanna tell u are correct. Now tell me how does showing us tds values alleviate our throat problems which I’m sure is from the water being supplied?
03/09/22, 11:27 pm - +91 99403 37313: For 2 3 days the taste of the water has definitely changed.. And it is not with our hostel but my labmate from Tamiraparani hostel also said same thing... The problem is from the source that is the water filling station.. My suggestion would be that the hostel authorities should tell to ccw to check this.... There is definitely a muddy taste in these water bottles from last 2 days.
03/09/22, 11:27 pm - +91 84313 34677: Totally agree with this. That must be the solution to this problem
03/09/22, 11:29 pm - +91 85418 58847: I am not contradicting you at all. I never said you didn’t have throat problems.

But see, I am just presenting the other side of the argument. The authorities will surely tell you that the water is fine because technically the TDS is in the correct range. You should prepare a counter argument. That’s all I am saying
03/09/22, 11:30 pm - +91 97110 43649: Pls write a complaint mail we will support
03/09/22, 11:30 pm - +91 84313 34677: Why take the other side when u are among the student’s side. It doesnt mean others dont have problems if u don’t have it right. If u don’t want to complain then that is totally fine. But let other students ask for their right of clean and healthy drinking water
03/09/22, 11:32 pm - +91 85418 58847: Yes, you certainly have the right to go forward if the complaint if you are experiencing problems. I am sorry, I didn’t mean to offend
03/09/22, 11:43 pm - +91 89470 69850: Yes
03/09/22, 11:45 pm - +91 89470 69850: There is no need for an argument
03/09/22, 11:46 pm - +91 89470 69850: I think majority of us are agreeing that water is not good now
03/09/22, 11:46 pm - +91 89470 69850: It sure tastes different
03/09/22, 11:47 pm - +91 89470 69850: On Monday we should ask our hostel authorities to look into this
03/09/22, 11:48 pm - +91 89470 69850: And don't tell them this TDS thing
03/09/22, 11:48 pm - +91 97110 43649: +1
03/09/22, 11:51 pm - +91 84313 34677: Agreed
03/09/22, 11:57 pm - +91 79804 18220: We can request the manager at the earliest to collect a sample of water in front of us and send it to lab(preferably private) for testing.
03/09/22, 11:58 pm - +91 89470 69850: Tomorrow I is Sunday

04/09/22, 10:48 am - +91 95535 34691: If you don’t overfill and put clothes properly, the machine works fine. Otherwise the unbalance throws the clothes outside

04/09/22, 1:33 pm - +91 95535 34691: Water is tap waterish in almost hostels I guess. I got similar response from Krishna. Can the health secretary take this up on why the quality deteriorated since last week

04/09/22, 3:27 pm - +91 88224 11339: Poor quality of drinking water at 1st floor
04/09/22, 3:34 pm - +91 70039 54884: At all floors
04/09/22, 3:59 pm - +91 98480 95257: Why can't we have an RO plant seperately for each hostel? seems very illogical and unsafe to carry cans from a centralised plant for these many hostels
04/09/22, 4:03 pm - +91 98480 95257: Or water filters

04/09/22, 7:14 pm - +91 70039 50664: Are Zomato/ swiggy now allowed to come upto hostels?
04/09/22, 7:16 pm - +91 70039 54884: Nope :)
04/09/22, 7:16 pm - +91 81458 31742: Check smail sometimes
04/09/22, 7:16 pm - +91 70039 54884: Either Taramani gate or Gajendra Circle
04/09/22, 7:17 pm - +91 70039 50664: Okkay

04/09/22, 7:31 pm - +91 94477 53083: I have seen some zomato delivery persons in hostel zone today also.
04/09/22, 7:37 pm - +91 85115 65232: Why they are not allowed
04/09/22, 7:37 pm - +91 85115 65232: ?
04/09/22, 7:48 pm - +91 79087 55490: Because they are not performing well in the GTA Playfield
04/09/22, 7:49 pm - +91 85115 65232: 😎
04/09/22, 7:56 pm - +91 83018 85364: They delivered today
04/09/22, 8:03 pm - +91 95535 34691: They are stopping most of them. Some who are are in regular clothes are escaping
04/09/22, 8:09 pm - +91 79087 55490: The new norm 😂😂
04/09/22, 8:59 pm - +91 94477 53083: They can allow through Taramani gate. I dnt knw what is the issue with that.
04/09/22, 8:59 pm - +91 97110 43649: Are they allowing dunzo delivery?
04/09/22, 9:00 pm - +91 97110 43649: They can, but i think they just want their pathetic Eateries to earn some bucks
04/09/22, 9:01 pm - +91 94477 53083: They say eateries are open. But, if people are satisfied with the food inside campus, then delivery traffic will automatically reduce. No need to enforce restrictions. But, they dont care. 🤷🏻‍♂️
04/09/22, 9:03 pm - +91 97110 43649: The issue I guess is that students don't have unity here, iitb recently partially rolled back fee hike because of student protests, can we even see 1% of such protest in iitm ?
04/09/22, 9:11 pm - +91 94477 53083: True. After covid, the situation became worse.
04/09/22, 9:22 pm - +91 79087 55490: Exactly
04/09/22, 9:30 pm - +91 94477 53083: Nowadays institute mails are like half spiritual (some events) and half unanswered student issues.
04/09/22, 10:36 pm - +91 97110 43649: It always has been that way😆
04/09/22, 10:51 pm - +91 94477 53083: It feels like 'If you are hungry, just meditate.. ' 🤷🏻‍♂️

1 just immediately after budget allocation then Second one in later......
Because whatever amount we spend in other things.....it won't matter much
10/09/22, 10:36 pm - +91 70039 54884: Another option whatever budget is left plus if we all contribute 10 to 15 rs each
We can have an ice cream night I guess.
Just that the Secretaries are not ready to take the initiative
10/09/22, 10:36 pm - +91 70442 42844: I guess...chaile atleast 1 ice cream night ta kora jete pare. Concerned authorities, kindly see if it is possible or not.

16/09/22, 4:56 pm - +91 77080 72829: Network people are saying the distribution switches (boards) are very old. That's why speed is less. Hostel only should purchase those switches. He says ask manager. No issue from network side
16/09/22, 4:57 pm - +91 94606 85411: Bro are the there in the hostel

16/09/22, 5:06 pm - +91 85115 65232: There is problem in pampa too
16/09/22, 5:06 pm - +91 85115 65232: But this needs to be resolved
16/09/22, 5:31 pm - +91 84394 30391: Same was pointed out last week when I asked them why there is frequent issue with LAN.
I even had a word with manager about it , he said by end of this month this would be done.
And i think hostel fund is not required for this , CCW will bear the burn
16/09/22, 5:33 pm - +91 84394 30391: Manager sir had informed that by end of September it will be fixed , I don't know how reliable the words are though
16/09/22, 5:55 pm - +91 91106 82101: Tamaraparani didn't have network for two full days, i think today morning or yesterday night only did it get fixed for them
16/09/22, 5:56 pm - +91 83018 85364: In our hostel, does any floor have internet?

16/09/22, 9:39 pm - +91 88853 66406: They won't. Everything has to do by hostel fund only. This semester fund didn't get to our hostel. We'll get this fund in this month. Small vendors are wanted immediate money. They are not waiting like proceeding payment. So give some time to us certainly resolve those issues like switch boards, lan issues, washing machines etc..
16/09/22, 9:55 pm - +91 84660 59931: Anyone I'm 4th floor facing network issues?
16/09/22, 9:55 pm - +91 83018 85364: We have no internet for 2 days in ground floor!

17/09/22, 10:06 am - +91 80746 21056: Did he do it coz you didn't leave a bucket or he removed yours midway to put in his clothes?
17/09/22, 10:16 am - +91 85115 65232: Even if he didn't keep the bucket there ... He could have kept his clothes in his bucket and then washed his clothes ... And then could have kept a message in the group .... This is not good in any circumstance
17/09/22, 10:19 am - +91 99200 11871: Is there any working Automatic Washing Machine on 3rd floor ?????
17/09/22, 10:22 am - +91 80746 21056: @918511565232 This could be the reason. Even if that guy picked up the clothes later from the floor and placed them in his bucket, OP wouldn't have known

18/09/22, 8:23 pm - +91 80876 92627: We should make such choices
18/09/22, 11:18 pm - +91 99946 34399: Is lan working in 2nd floor?
18/09/22, 11:26 pm - +91 84394 30391: Nahii bhai

18/09/22, 11:49 pm - +91 70088 70428: Now I am literally frustrated how we are treated in this hstl..
No internet no facilities everything is in a halt..
18/09/22, 11:51 pm - +91 82729 09591: Every other day something is amiss with the system
18/09/22, 11:52 pm - +91 82729 09591: Have all the switches on all the floors been tested?
18/09/22, 11:54 pm - +91 82729 09591: The frequency at which this occurs suggests that the issue is more likely to be in the switches inside the hostel
18/09/22, 11:55 pm - +91 70031 26090: Actually we should ask ccw to install WiFi's in our hostel
Then most of these problems will get resolved
18/09/22, 11:57 pm - +91 70088 70428: do u think they wld agree.. better they make d switches replaced and provide stable internet
19/09/22, 12:02 am - +91 82729 09591: Installing routers won't really fix much.
19/09/22, 12:03 am - +91 82729 09591: Another query, does any of the floors have a connection now?
19/09/22, 12:09 am - +91 85418 58847: The net is working on Linux but not on Windows. I have noticed this for the last few days
19/09/22, 12:11 am - +91 70039 54884: Also don't use mobile Hotspot from laptop to connect your mobile to the internet
19/09/22, 12:11 am - +91 85418 58847: <Media omitted>
19/09/22, 12:13 am - +91 82729 09591: Network is back

19/09/22, 12:32 am - +91 98678 37598: We are still having network issues.
19/09/22, 7:52 am - +91 84394 30391: Why ??
19/09/22, 8:18 am - +91 81458 31742: Anyone have paracetamol tablet?
19/09/22, 8:22 am - +91 94477 53083: Ask hostel security. Usually some first aid medicines will be there.
19/09/22, 9:00 am - +91 85418 58847: It was a bug in a previous version of Windows. It has been fixed now 

Basically, if you used hotspot from Windows to connect your phone, net would stop working on the laptop

21/09/22, 10:56 am - +91 83018 85364: Because of that I gave application for change of hostel🫠
21/09/22, 11:15 am - +91 95603 94281: 😕 don't u guys think, configuration of router is just an excuse from their side ?

21/09/22, 11:47 am - +91 88537 00390: Please change name from Mahanadhi hostel group to Bhai net chal rha kya
21/09/22, 11:49 am - +91 77080 72829: the service person confirmed. If router issue, the access will be severed. But slow speed is purely hardware problem from their side
21/09/22, 11:51 am - +91 97110 43649: I talked to manager he said at max by the end of this month this issue will be resolved, let's wait and see till 30th

22/09/22, 7:03 am - +91 88922 15619: The fuck... The locking up room has started again.. I have been locked up in room number 249
22/09/22, 7:25 am - +91 87084 74376: Nothing new😷🫢
22/09/22, 7:57 am - +91 85115 65232: I don't understand why there is no CCTV in hostels that is completely rubbish behaviour by authorities
22/09/22, 7:58 am - +91 85115 65232: There can be theft or any other inappropriate activity... There should be CCTV cameras in working condition in hostels
22/09/22, 8:44 am - +91 97486 72248: Although I want this kind of things to stop, but still I don't think installing CCTVs in every floor is a good idea. It's to much intrusion to privacy anyway
22/09/22, 8:51 am - +91 88922 15619: What is the privacy issue.. can you elaborate
22/09/22, 8:53 am - +91 97486 72248: For example when I come back to my room after taking a bath I don't want to be caught in camera half naked.
22/09/22, 8:54 am - +91 88922 15619: Isn't convenience is something we can trade with security..
22/09/22, 8:57 am - +91 84313 34677: But u still will be seen half naked by people living in hostel🤔
22/09/22, 8:57 am - +91 97486 72248: As I said, I am not against it, but I don't think it is a full proof idea either
22/09/22, 8:57 am - +91 97486 72248: 😂 both are different ain't it?
22/09/22, 8:58 am - +91 84313 34677: CCTV would cost too much and we don’t have budget to even repair washing machines!🫠. So as you said its not gonna work. We have to find other better solutions
22/09/22, 8:59 am - +91 84313 34677: <Media omitted>
22/09/22, 8:59 am - +91 97486 72248: 🥲 wi-fi also needed

22/09/22, 9:31 am - +91 88537 00390: Kyonki election nahi hua😊
22/09/22, 9:32 am - +91 80876 92627: No hostel is rich enough for cctv.
22/09/22, 9:32 am - +91 80876 92627: We should first fix washing machine problem
22/09/22, 9:32 am - +91 80876 92627: That psycho guy will be caught one day don’t worry
22/09/22, 9:33 am - +91 97486 72248: Yep but our hostel isn't rich enough for BBQ night either 🥲
22/09/22, 9:33 am - +91 97486 72248: Hope so...

22/09/22, 12:01 pm - +91 88853 66406: Budget not allocated to our hostel yet. Everything will done in this semester. 100% we'll do it.
22/09/22, 12:12 pm - +91 88922 15619: Why does he sound like a politician 🤣
22/09/22, 12:16 pm - +91 88594 08799: 🤣
22/09/22, 12:23 pm - +91 81458 31742: I think they have to reshuffle their cabinet. Else only 3 secretary's message we saw here, rest are like retired
22/09/22, 12:34 pm - +91 89470 69850: But what about election?
22/09/22, 12:34 pm - +91 89470 69850: New budget should be given to new team
22/09/22, 12:34 pm - +91 89470 69850: Elected by students

22/09/22, 12:37 pm - +91 89470 69850: Like the one we have in our hostel entrance
22/09/22, 12:37 pm - +91 89470 69850: New budget will be allotted to new team only
22/09/22, 12:37 pm - +91 89470 69850: We have to make sure of this

22/09/22, 9:29 pm - +91 89184 99682: Now,It’s getting serious..We have to do something to solve this issue..Very pathetic situation..
22/09/22, 9:53 pm - +91 98801 39699: Can we all email CCW independently again about internet. 
They are the authority for hostel premises. They will procure hardware that is needed to rectify the issue.
22/09/22, 9:53 pm - +91 98842 99098: It is not justified to pay the same amount of Est-B fee, if we dont get same facilities as other hostel residents are getting. Either ccw improve facilities in our hostel or collect less amount
22/09/22, 9:55 pm - +91 98801 39699: If CCW chair receives volumes of email about Mahanadi hostel, maybe our issue will get noticed

15/10/22, 1:01 pm - +91 84313 34677: Doing it only on ground level will make the mosquitoes flee to upper levels
15/10/22, 1:01 pm - +91 84313 34677: Start with 6th floor and go down
15/10/22, 2:02 pm - +91 88224 11339: No network on 1st floor
15/10/22, 2:03 pm - +91 88224 11339: This is regular issue now a days
15/10/22, 2:03 pm - +91 88224 11339: Hostel authorities taking it casually
15/10/22, 2:37 pm - +91 77080 72829: Office people are saying fogging is done by chennai corporation. It's their wish to fog or not fog higher floors. Manager can't control that. 
I think the best option is to buy a fogging machine for our hostel. It will cost around 3-4K. It should also b included in our budget
15/10/22, 2:40 pm - +91 79804 18220: +1

But chennai corporation is getting paid for doing fogging.
15/10/22, 2:40 pm - +91 84313 34677: What kind of answer is this by our manager? He isnt even managing anything. He has left everything on students and now this irresponsible replies as well. Is it chennai corporation’s wish to get people bitten by mosquitoes? I’ve already suffered dengue once and if I get dengue again will the corporation or the manager be responsible?
15/10/22, 2:57 pm - +91 70039 54884: True
15/10/22, 2:57 pm - +91 70039 54884: The manager doesn't seem to care anything here
15/10/22, 2:57 pm - +91 91106 82101: This is a highly irresponsible answer which implies our college does not care for the welfare of its students.... I would suggest discussing it with the warden instead
15/10/22, 3:23 pm - +91 85115 65232: Can we write to warden ??
15/10/22, 3:32 pm - +91 97110 43649: What bs is this we should complain to dean regarding this
15/10/22, 3:32 pm - +91 97110 43649: Yes we should also next time @918885366406 when fogging is done
15/10/22, 3:33 pm - +91 97110 43649: Please ask manager to appoint a person to take video of each floor being fogged
15/10/22, 3:33 pm - +91 97110 43649: Then we can submit a proof regarding this bs going on
15/10/22, 3:49 pm - +91 85115 65232: Agreed
15/10/22, 3:52 pm - +91 81458 31742: I requested last time for fogging each floor, but Manager told last time that it's not possible
15/10/22, 3:54 pm - +91 97110 43649: Then let's write to warden first
15/10/22, 3:55 pm - +91 97110 43649: Since rainy season is coming this can become serious
15/10/22, 3:56 pm - +91 81458 31742: Manager is always staying silent in GBM & infront of Warden sir,
Other time his voice is totally different.
15/10/22, 3:58 pm - +91 91106 82101: Already a few cases of dengue have been reported in campus
15/10/22, 3:58 pm - +91 97110 43649: 😂

(You read it correctly 😜😜)
There will be a monthly inter hostel competition kind of thing, that how sustainable your hostel.
Only 3 parameters 
1. Electricity uses per students.
2. Water uses per students.
3. How well we are segregating/managing our waste.
If you want this.... start to switch off before leaving for laboratory 
( Very soon we will be starting this practice from Sustainability club)

Users of common kitchen room, needs to return the items back. Also make sure that utensils are cleaned. 

(I noticed sometimes they are not cleaning it properly).

If people are not returning the items back, we need to make a rule like not allowing the utensils to their room. They need to bring their own items to take their cooked food's.

20/10/22, 11:37 pm - +91 97110 43649: Why don't we just remove this lift, atleast no one will get hurt and a chunk budget is wasted on these lifts, every other week I see a repairman doing repairs 😅

Yesterday I came back to my room from lab arround 4 and went to restroom for 10 mins by just latching my room(413), when I came back an unknown guy was siting inside by room and when I entered he asked me can I sleep here for 2 hrs..? 
I am new joinee I was not alloted hostel. 
When I enquired he said my name is abhinav and MBA 1st yr(2022) batch guy..

The security took him down and was sitted on the sofa and he ran away when the security went to discuss talk with assistant warden..
21/10/22, 8:14 am - +91 70088 70428: *My point is how he entered the hostel and had guts to come inside my room in these abbreviated state..

Its a matter of concern of the security..
He could have stolen by essentials..
He could have attacked me..
He could have created any kind of havoc and at that time whom would I have called for help if he would have threatned me..

Its serious issue of security please take necessary steps.. Otherwise I am going to take this matter to the higher authorities..*

21/10/22, 7:47 pm - +91 83496 97707: We have to fight for our rights and the strange thing is that some people will take courage and will come forward to do that others will enjoy the fruits, on a sense it is perfectly fine that everyone cannot come and do the things which other social science student do generally, we are the technical or engineering people so we will behave accordingly and will not create mess. So I request all friends if somebody coming forward *so the least you can do is to support them*, you may feel these ill logical currently but believe me , when you are giving test of placement and suddenly LAN stop working and etc....
21/10/22, 7:47 pm - +91 83496 97707: will take forward this election thing
21/10/22, 8:01 pm - +91 89685 99941: Can u please text in this group once it will be started
21/10/22, 8:18 pm - +91 84393 73413: Dear authorities or whomsoever. Please notice- Last time I mailed directly to dean Academic and Director kept warden in CC for complaining about internet and other issue, I was called by warden on a very next day for discussing the issue in hostel and he assured us to reslove the issue with manager ASAP. 
If you continue to do ignore the complaint, we will mail Ist warden about the current situation and if not resolved ASAP, it'll go directly to dean and director, Ofcourse we'll go by procedure ( we believe our warder is kind enough to understand the our current scenario).

I'm writing here just because you guys should notice the issue Ist and handle the issue. 

Thank you
21/10/22, 8:20 pm - +91 88853 66406: Sweets are available at security guard. Plz have it frnds.
21/10/22, 8:20 pm - +91 84393 73413: and Also if you need to discuss how to handle the current situation please feel free to meet @919978073246

21/10/22, 8:57 pm - +91 99780 73246: 🤔🤔🤔
21/10/22, 8:59 pm - +91 83496 97707: I heard from some of my friends that sweets had been finished.
I hope you all got it.
Let me tell you the mistake if someone missed it.
People are coming and taking 2-3 boxes of sweets etc.

*What they should do is that they have a list of all the residing students, so they should give sweets or anything and take their signature or just tick mark so that everyone can get it*
21/10/22, 9:43 pm - +91 91106 82101: This signature buisness doesn't work, when i had gone to collect my sweets in the afternoon someone had already signed in my place 😂
21/10/22, 9:52 pm - +91 84393 73413: its already finished when i went to collect
21/10/22, 9:57 pm - +91 84393 73413: only two possibilities is there..
(1) either the hostler are too honest so they took multiple times.
(2) less quantity were ordered

I believe the students are not that chep so i won't go for 1st.
21/10/22, 9:57 pm - +91 84393 73413: *cheap
21/10/22, 10:15 pm - +91 84313 34677: The sweets were given by security and he was marking the people who got sweets. So probably people wouldn’t have take more than one. PROBABLY!
21/10/22, 10:24 pm - +91 98842 99098: May be the security need to check id cards from next rime onwards. I think there we surplus sweets were purchased. Some sweets and mixture packets were there even by 8:30 p.m. 

Also, we need to fix some time slot for sweet distribution.
21/10/22, 10:25 pm - +91 84313 34677: Yes. I got mine around 8:30
21/10/22, 10:30 pm - +91 98842 99098: *were

22/10/22, 12:19 am - +91 81458 31742: yes..he's going through something personal 
the Faculty Advisors are talking to him and trying to help him out

that's why he was allotted a separate room too..
but I guess he didn't have the key when he returned to the hostel yesterday 

anyways..
I shall speak to him 

I can understand..it will definitely be shocking for anyone to see a random person sleeping in their bed.

Apologies on his behalf 🙇‍♂️

04/11/22, 8:34 pm - +91 80053 64128: By rules, no you can't. You can book a room in TGH and let him stay there( though i think this you already know ). Without thinking about rules you can, just ask your friend to provide him a ID card, incase guard check him while entering hostel which I seldom think they will do. He can stay by using this method easily for 1 or 2 days. 

_*Disclaimer: I am not motivating you to break the rules. I am just pointing out some flaws which can be exploited.*_

18/11/22, 5:56 pm - +91 87935 84232: @919059717081 since you're the health secretary what's the status of hand wash? For past month wash basins in RR8 don't have a handwash. Where exactly is our hostel fee being utilised!?
18/11/22, 5:57 pm - +91 97110 43649: +1 , also what about fogging, everyday mosquitoes are inc
18/11/22, 5:58 pm - +91 70835 62837: Yes same with all bathrooms on 4th floor
18/11/22, 5:58 pm - +91 87935 84232: The cleaning people tell that they don't have stock for handwash. When I went to manager he said that health secretary has ordered the handwash online. @919059717081 why do you need to order simple things like handwash online? Go to any local supermarket and buy it. If you can't, tell me and I'll go and buy. Bigbasket/Instamart also have discounts and deliver the same day.
18/11/22, 6:02 pm - +91 97002 76503: We will purchase a new one in a week time positively 👍
18/11/22, 6:06 pm - +91 70251 40314: The one in Third floor( near rr16) is not working for a month or something...I told manager directly long ago...his reply was that it's extra one...I guess that meant he is not gonna do anything...please look into this as well... it's our on Money getting wasted...
18/11/22, 6:16 pm - +91 97002 76503: @917025140314 kindly first please know the facts then comment that our money is wasted or not... technical secretary related budget is used extensively...already in a month 3 new washing machines, one ironing board,one water dispenser,one fridge has been procured...Many washing machines have been repaired....Do not pass a common observation for everything....Concern about water filter we have budget to accommodate only one more filter...that will be purchased this month....
18/11/22, 6:18 pm - +91 70251 40314: If a new water dispenser is here, not working and giving directly the water from the can, isn't it a waste of money??
18/11/22, 6:19 pm - +91 70251 40314: I am saying there should be at least an effort to repair it.. i
18/11/22, 6:20 pm - +91 97002 76503: First kindly mention in the complaint book...then if it's not done report it to warden....
18/11/22, 6:21 pm - +91 70251 40314: Directly telling it to the manager is not enough...? I asked him that time only that if i should write the complaint down? He said no, he'll send someone to check it .. I was irritated by that negligence actually ...
18/11/22, 6:21 pm - +91 70251 40314: It's okay...I can take water from the other dispenser...but that's not how things should be...
18/11/22, 6:22 pm - +91 97002 76503: No it will not work...You see the complaint book for every complaint there is a resolution written using red ink...i recommend you to write a official complain
18/11/22, 6:22 pm - +91 70251 40314: Sure...I will write a complaint... Let's solve the problem somehow..
18/11/22, 6:23 pm - +91 97002 76503: Yes but i will keep you informed that mostly these dispenser donot get repaired since the major issue will be compressor problem....so a new one only we have to purchase which will require a budget as per this budget i will buy 2...
18/11/22, 6:24 pm - +91 97002 76503: Just mention in the book at least first let me get the technician advice...
18/11/22, 6:24 pm - +91 97002 76503: Thanks @917025140314 👍
18/11/22, 6:24 pm - +91 70251 40314: Yep..

23/11/22, 7:51 pm - +91 95535 34691: Nothing wrong with the food. It’s just wrong marketing. Next time it should be hosted as evening feast.

Well now we know which caterer to not call next time...
23/11/22, 8:01 pm - +91 98842 99098: I just curious to know whether the restaurent publicity is in the agreement or they are doing just like that. If not, we need to charge for this. The restaurent is not doing any favour for us. It costs the same amount even if we directly dine at the restaurant.
23/11/22, 8:03 pm - +91 90467 51993: Ok that one is gulab jamun.
I thought Elaichi.🥲
23/11/22, 8:03 pm - +91 70039 54884: Their marketing strategy was give less amount so that students tend to buy another plate
23/11/22, 8:04 pm - +91 70039 54884: Sahi khel gaya

*Reply from network team*
               

Connect the LAN cable from the wall socket (I/O)  to your Laptop / Desktop and go to command prompt / terminal on your system.

A black screen (window) will open. Type ipconfig for windows and ifconfig for Linux and press enter.

It will display some outputs.

Look at the IPV4 address.

If it's in the series of 10.21.xxx.xx. (Academic) 10.22.xxx.xx (Hostel), 10.23.xxx.xx (Residence) then you're getting the correct network IP address.

If it is displayed as "media disconnected" then check with any other LAN cable.

If the IP address is displayed as above then try the below command:

ping netaccess.iitm.ac.in

The output should be:

64 bytes from 10.24.0.147 (10.24.0.147): icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=0.405 ms

64 bytes from 10.24.0.147 (10.24.0.147): icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=0.311 ms

The network is fine. 

If "netaccess.iitm.ac.in" is not giving the above output, then check the DNS server settings. Fix DNS as automatic on your network settings.

ALSO

Disable IPv6 in Network Adapter Properties

Press the Windows logo key + R / search to open the Run dialog. Type ncpa.cpl and hit Enter. 

It will open the Network Connections window. Right-click the network adapter Ethernet to disable IPv6 on, and then select Properties.

In order to disable IPv6, uncheck the box next to Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6).

Click OK. 

Then follow the below steps:

Access external sites like google, yahoo etc., you need to login every day netaccess.iitm.ac.in using your LDAP credentials and approve your IP. Make sure while approving netaccess, check the IP Address should be your system IP address eg. 10.21.xxx.xxx, 10.22.xxx.xx, 10.23.xxx.xx.. If it is not as above, check the proxy settings on your browser. Kindly remove the proxy and approve your IP for internet access.

Check the proxy settings on your browser. Kindly remove the proxy and approve your IP for internet access.

If you want to find whether proxy is enabled in browser or not just login to "netaccess.iitm.ac.in" page using your LDAP credentials. If the IP is in the series of 10.24.4.222 then proxy is enabled. Disabled it and refresh the netaccess page. You will get your system IP. Approve and authorize the IP.

If you still experience any trouble kindly revert back to us with your system mac address, room no., hostel name and contact mobile no. and the output of the above commands and send these details through email to “helpdesknetworks@iitm.ac.in”.

To find system mac address:

Go to command prompt / terminal on your system.

Type getmac -v for windows and then press enter.

You will see the mac address (ethernet physical address) in the form of 12 digits(numbers & characters)​

The incident is of 26/6/2022, Uttar Pradesh Police is not taking any proper action, on the contrary, it is trying to end the case. Corruption of the police of Uttar Pradesh at its peak.  Please retweet it.

25/12/22, 12:07 pm - +91 94860 87050: Please come and collect it.
25/12/22, 12:07 pm - +91 94860 87050: If someone wants to take two Samosa, please get it from Security desk

25/12/22, 12:45 pm - +91 94860 87050: Hereafter, we are not taking the room number from Students. Whoever wants whatever (Samosa/ Sweet), they can take it from Security desk till its available.
25/12/22, 1:30 pm - +91 80746 21056: How come this is allowed? No laddus left now for those returning from labs
25/12/22, 1:33 pm - +91 77080 72829: +1. Unfair
25/12/22, 1:43 pm - +91 94243 96487: @Secies or whoever was responsible for sweet distribution.

This is not the correct way of distribution🥲. In this manner the people who came in beginning took how much they wanted & now nothing is left for others😞.If there was some specific time for distribution it should be informed to students one day ahead so that they can arrange their plans accordingly...

This was just what I thought. I am not blaming or anything.

25/12/22, 2:14 pm - +91 88537 00390: <Media omitted>
25/12/22, 2:15 pm - +91 94860 87050: I have informed this through notice board and by pasting it near lift. Also reminded it WA group.

Whenever we distribute, some people wants to take an extra (like they don't like Samosa, instead of that they want Sweet) or some people will miss the prefixed timings. I expected this also. So I have kept some 20-25 quantity as a buffer. Now I will hand over it to Security guard to distribute. *Whoever miss it earlier, Please come and Collect it as early as possible.*

Sweets - Only for the people who missed it.
Samosa - Anyone can take (it still available in large numbers)

Kind request is that Please Collect the Sweets and Snacks before it may get spoiled
25/12/22, 2:59 pm - +91 98841 77994: They arranged enough. 🙏
25/12/22, 3:01 pm - Vivek Ta: Please stop justifying your acts and plan accordingly from next time. 

Keeping buffer should be the last possible alternative. 

There is no whatsapp message regarding this sweet distribution this time as you have claimed. 

Kindly use only one, i.e., either whatsapp or noticeboard for official communication.

     On behalf of the "SUSTAINABLE CAMPUS COLLECTIVE" campaign, We are planning to take steps to reduce food waste from messes, In the current scenario each and every day around 1500 kg of food waste is generated. We are looking forward to reducing it by 40% as soon as possible.
To achieve this destination your valuable opinion is highly appreciated.
Please go through the attached google form. Thank you in advance.
11/01/23, 12:20 am - +91 81458 31742: Please try to fill this
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
11/01/23, 10:26 am - +91 79780 53326: Ask them to improve the quality and taste of the food.. wastage will be reduced by 75%
11/01/23, 10:27 am - +91 85115 65232: Agreed
11/01/23, 10:28 am - +91 85115 65232: They degrade the quality of food after mess registration is over.
11/01/23, 10:29 am - +91 81458 31742: Yes, We will show the data to the mess manager, 
So that they can get to know the reason.
11/01/23, 10:29 am - +91 81458 31742: Else, they will not believe,
11/01/23, 10:32 am - +91 79780 53326: I think Most of us take food in the plate according to hunger but eat according to taste.
11/01/23, 10:48 am - +91 88224 11339: Exactly
11/01/23, 10:49 am - +91 88224 11339: If the taste is good, wastage will be less. Anyway we have to reduce the wastage, good initiative.

It isn't just a hostel , we are like a family
13/02/23, 6:04 pm - +91 88853 66406: Yes bro. I knew. I'm telling mesh up in the group is not good. Very sad situation to us. We can't change it na brother. That's why I told like that.
13/02/23, 6:04 pm - +91 88853 66406: RIP to him💐💐💐
13/02/23, 6:30 pm - +91 80053 64128: It's sad to hear someone died . Recently a person died in IIT Bombay too. I guess more awareness should be there and people should discuss and make sure nobody feels a tendency to kill themselves. We are a family😊
13/02/23, 6:51 pm - +91 98841 77994: IITs should take a serious call now. It is becoming a regular incident.
13/02/23, 7:13 pm - +91 87900 11593: IITs are "OK" with it...
IITs are not meant for student wellness (as we know how far MITR works. They are just there)
IITs are meant for NIRF, Qos rankings. So asking IITs to take a call on these type of areas is of utter waste.
You are not the only who told IITs should take a call now...
Its been saying for the past 15 yrs
13/02/23, 7:16 pm - +91 87935 84232: True. They simply don't care.
13/02/23, 7:19 pm - +91 87900 11593: And relax, after 3 days everything gets to normal as how it got when a student did the same thing in Tapti last year
13/02/23, 7:20 pm - +91 98841 77994: Nothing happenes in our system untill it takes life or people do mass protest. Here also its the same and perhaps needs to do the same. 

Both Saathi Mitr are useless. 
Its time that insti must hear students voice now. We must call for a administrative meeting.
13/02/23, 7:21 pm - +91 87900 11593: We get too busy in our works. Its not because we don't have emotions... It's because we have our own situations...
After all we are just humans who say "past is past jo hogya so hogya" and lead the normal life from tomorrow
13/02/23, 7:25 pm - +91 99693 94156: I think max they can do is stick posters of Mitr on doors and send empty emails with posters
13/02/23, 7:26 pm - +91 87900 11593: With a mail 
"Contact us if you feel distressed"
13/02/23, 7:26 pm - +91 87900 11593: Forgetting the logic that a depressed person stops communicating with otger people
13/02/23, 7:28 pm - +91 98841 77994: We shall have a hostel meeting with dost etc soon with residents. We must sepak up.
13/02/23, 7:29 pm - +91 80053 64128: He does but he does that when he thinks other will not understand or he thinks he don't have anyone so close to discuss that. Many times sucide has been avoided too just by a small tall.
13/02/23, 7:52 pm - +91 70088 70428: I have a small request to secretaries if possible arrange a small prayer for the guy. And we can atleast discuss with the guys arround here and encourage them to discuss if they have any problem in their life
13/02/23, 7:53 pm - +91 80790 59978: 👍
13/02/23, 7:57 pm - +91 88853 66406: Sure. Certainly, we'll arrange it

13/02/23, 10:52 pm - +91 70188 46658: they constantly pressurize either convert to PhD or hunger for research paper
13/02/23, 10:59 pm - +91 87900 11593: You forgot to mention...
There are people (guides) who also ask to downgrade beacuse of no publications or unsatisfied progress in research work
13/02/23, 11:02 pm - +91 70188 46658: problem is there with administration 
1) while fee hike so many students drop mails no reply from them
2) While hundred of mails regarding food quality no reply from them
3) second suicide in campus within 6 months no reply from them 

USELESS SELFISH PEOPLE
13/02/23, 11:06 pm - +91 70188 46658: can we do some candle march in the front of main gate and highlight this issue to media

13/02/23, 11:07 pm - +91 70188 46658: intentionally loss of someone son , brother, husband and one's life
13/02/23, 11:08 pm - +91 70188 46658: if it comes in media only then some effect will happen otherwise another case will happen within few months
13/02/23, 11:12 pm - +91 88224 11339: Sometimes guides plays an important role in this process of self killing, research people always under stress to write papers….even though MS scholar not required to publish paper, still it’s must….
13/02/23, 11:20 pm - +91 80790 59978: Exactly, we should do this
13/02/23, 11:22 pm - +91 88224 11339: At least at our hostel front for condolence
13/02/23, 11:35 pm - Divyanshu: Even in entrepreneurship course, I was asked to publish research paper
13/02/23, 11:51 pm - +91 88853 66406: TQ for supporting us. But please calm down.  We'll conduct meeting for this issue. N I'll inform the date about it. TQ to all.
13/02/23, 11:55 pm - +91 98748 18871: It is quite true in some cases....
13/02/23, 11:59 pm - +91 98801 39699: I like how Shankar’s tone changed from “Don’t create nuisance” to now “TQ to all”. 

Admin will always try to suppress the incident in name of privacy. Their hope is student will forget in couple days.

We must respect the privacy, we are Not interested in gossip. But we wish for better discussion about mental-health and life-loss at IIT.

Greetings
I hope you all are well and doing good. 
I am *Harsh Kumar* , research scholar  residing in Sindhu hostel. 
As you all know, from today onwards the campaigning period started. This year I am standing for the post of Research Affairs Secretary. Even though in the past, few amendments are done to the ordinance. But still, there are many things on which we still need to work for the betterment of research scholars. We,research scholars, are facing problems from all directions that need to be resolved. 

We can work peacefully and can focus on our research work only when we don't have any unnecessary pressure.
There should be something that assures 360° fitness to scholars ranging from technical to mental wellness. 

There should be one person who represents you to the authorities and gets work done in your favor. 

Being the CDC-R head, I understand the needs and necessities of research scholars. So I request you to support me in winning the election for the post of Research Affairs Secretary 

Here by I m sharing my manifesto with you.

20/02/23, 11:03 pm - +91 96236 44088: Anybody knows which all buildings come under hostel zone?
20/02/23, 11:05 pm - +91 87935 84232: Same doubt I was also having. Are they considering mess buildings, zaitoon, primemart etc in hostel zone? Because I'm pretty sure the vendors would be paying for electricity separately.
20/02/23, 11:05 pm - +91 94606 85411: 1000rs a month is exorbitant for a fan and a tubelight. And im an architect i know what I'm saying. It basically 110-120watt running. Even if it's on for 24/7 with some use of washing machine elevator it's still exorbitant
20/02/23, 11:05 pm - +91 94606 85411: And educational institute should have subsidies over these things
20/02/23, 11:06 pm - +91 91106 82101: There are various departments that run a central AC system 24/7 and i don't understand how hostels that use fan and light can be more costly
20/02/23, 11:10 pm - +91 88224 11339: +1
20/02/23, 11:13 pm - +91 91106 82101: I think in IITM we are imposed sanctions 😂
Paying such high rates is a scam
20/02/23, 11:19 pm - +91 87935 84232: <Media omitted>
20/02/23, 11:21 pm - +91 81458 31742: I know that mess are paying bill separately.
20/02/23, 11:23 pm - +91 81458 31742: And one more thing, the academic section has all the central AC mostly.
How can only the hostel consume 1/3rd ...!

''Honouring the Past, Optimizing the Present and Shaping our Future'' With this Vision in mind, I plan to strengthen and revamp IITM's Sporting Culture.

I am Abhishek Katre, a 3rd Year undergraduate student in the department of Metallurgy and Material Science, and I am contesting for the post of Institute Sports Secretary 2023-24. For me, sports is not a hobby; it's my passion that fuels my mind, body, and soul.

With utmost sincerity, I stand for this position to expand the reach of this sphere and make sports much more accessible for all. I want the world of sports to be a source of motivation, peace, and happiness for everyone.

I ask for your love and support to my campaign to make this a reality and incorporate sports as an inevitable part of everyone’s life.

Contesting for Research Affairs Secretary(RAS). I am planning to bring a considerable number of changes in the existing RAS team in order to improve the placements by tuning the placements cell, establishing a problem-solving cell where scholars can address their issues (professional as well as mental health related). Will seek to provide post-tenure support for researchers by connecting them with industries via R-connect. We also intend to introduce R-clubs to access and learn tools and software from different labs/departments. We also intend to introduce R-clubs to access and learn tools and software from different labs/departments. Introduce orientation sessions, physical brochures, and research facilities vlogs for outreaching the team.

Guys important message

While using automatic machines.
Make sure that water does not go into the button panels...that create problem in machines

Many people put water through buckets to wash it in less time.Do not do that.

Greetings
I hope you all are well and doing good. 
I am *Harsh Kumar* , research scholar  residing in Sindhu hostel. 
As you all know, from today onwards the campaigning period started. This year I am standing for the post of Research Affairs Secretary. Even though in the past, few amendments are done to the ordinance. But still, there are many things on which we still need to work for the betterment of research scholars. We,research scholars, are facing problems from all directions that need to be resolved. 

We can work peacefully and can focus on our research work only when we don't have any unnecessary pressure.
There should be something that assures 360° fitness to scholars ranging from technical to mental wellness. 

There should be one person who represents you to the authorities and gets work done in your favor. 

Being the CDC-R head, I understand the needs and necessities of research scholars. So I request you to support me in winning the election for the post of Research Affairs Secretary 

Here by I m sharing my manifesto with you.

Encouraging Diversity: I will work to promote a more diverse and inclusive environment in our department by providing access to a wider range of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences in order to foster an inclusive research community.

I am committed to achieving these goals, and I believe that with your support, we can make our department a better place to learn and research. As your Department Legislator of Research, I will represent your interests, listen to your concerns, and work tirelessly to create a positive impact in our department.

02/03/23, 6:35 pm - +91 87935 84232: Dear All,

I'm Chathri Poshadri
PhD 3rd Year 
Mechanical Engineering Department 
Contesting for Research Affairs Secretary(RAS). I am planning to bring a considerable number of changes in the existing RAS team in order to improve the placements by tuning the placements cell, establishing a problem-solving cell where scholars can address their issues (professional as well as mental health related). Will seek to provide post-tenure support for researchers by connecting them with industries via R-connect. We also intend to introduce R-clubs to access and learn tools and software from different labs/departments. Introduce orientation sessions, physical brochures, and research facilities vlogs for outreaching the team.

"I will become a strong voice of the scholars. We will work together for the betterment of every scholar."

Please support Us...


Warm regards

08/03/23, 10:55 pm - +91 79804 18220: Is internet there on 3rd floor?
08/03/23, 10:55 pm - +91 70251 40314: Ys
08/03/23, 10:58 pm - +91 79804 18220: Yeah, it came now for me
09/03/23, 9:44 am - +91 84313 34677: <Media omitted>
09/03/23, 9:44 am - +91 84313 34677: This is the only hostel that has *all* the issues
09/03/23, 10:32 am - +91 80790 59978: This is not the first time it has happened. Many times I stuck inside also. I complained several times but nobody is taking any action.
09/03/23, 10:35 am - +91 85115 65232: This is very dangerous and can prove to be lethal please correct this flaw people have died in these situations before
09/03/23, 10:35 am - +91 85115 65232: You have been warned here, if anything happens, there will be consequences
09/03/23, 10:57 am - +91 88853 66406: We took an action on it. Even though, it happened.
09/03/23, 11:27 am - +91 91106 82101: Put smail bro, tag everyone that's the only way this hostel will ever become good
09/03/23, 11:30 am - +91 85115 65232: That means the action was not appropriate and you have to tell the authorities how dangerous is the situation... What is the meaning of taking action if doesn't solve the problem
09/03/23, 12:11 pm - +91 87633 74318: Whenever this happens

Lift door slams close at very high velocity which is high enough to cause very severe injury.
09/03/23, 12:11 pm - +91 87633 74318: Be careful whenever this happens
09/03/23, 12:14 pm - +91 84313 34677: I had to take stairs to ground floor. I’ll never take a risk with our hostel lifts
09/03/23, 12:14 pm - +91 84313 34677: More like we should call them drops instead of lifts from now on
09/03/23, 12:22 pm - +91 80790 59978: Ya exactly, if someone stuck in between the doos in such situations then that door will definitely crush their head.
09/03/23, 12:23 pm - +91 80790 59978: @secretary. Please raise this issue seriously
09/03/23, 12:24 pm - +91 80790 59978: This happened to me twice, but luckily I was inside the lift.
09/03/23, 12:25 pm - +91 85115 65232: True
09/03/23, 12:25 pm - +91 85115 65232: Better
09/03/23, 12:25 pm - +91 85115 65232: We should all fix a time and go to manager
09/03/23, 12:25 pm - +91 85115 65232: This is getting out of hand
09/03/23, 12:25 pm - +91 85115 65232: Same is with fogging
09/03/23, 12:25 pm - +91 85115 65232: Mosquitoes are too much
09/03/23, 1:08 pm - +91 88853 66406: Already informed to warden. He informed to engineering unit.
09/03/23, 1:08 pm - +91 85115 65232: Better to use stairs guys
09/03/23, 1:10 pm - +91 88853 66406: Fogging was doing regularly. We can't tell them to do day by day. They were doing weekly basis in our hostel. Even though, I informed to do twice in a week.
09/03/23, 1:26 pm - +91 72509 22521: We never witness foogging in 3rd floor from last one month

09/03/23, 3:47 pm - +91 84393 73413: whoever smoking cigarette at 3rd floor please buy a good one it doesn't smell gud

09/03/23, 9:12 pm - +91 81458 31742: It can not be replace
09/03/23, 9:12 pm - +91 81458 31742: 😛😛
09/03/23, 9:29 pm - +91 88853 66406: New one
09/03/23, 9:30 pm - +91 88853 66406: Whoever broken, that person has to replace it.
09/03/23, 9:31 pm - +91 88853 66406: Then, buy n keep it in kitchen place.
10/03/23, 12:01 am - +91 81458 31742: 😂😂😂😂
10/03/23, 12:03 am - +91 81458 31742: I'll not buy this
10/03/23, 12:03 am - +91 81458 31742: There should be some fixed budget for kitchen items....and  no items will stay for lifetimes.
10/03/23, 12:05 am - +91 81458 31742: And already lots of items are misplaced by someone ( maybe managers or students or secretary) 
We don't even know how many items are actually bought for the kitchen? And how many are there?
10/03/23, 12:11 am - +91 88853 66406: Not for the broken things. This is not ur personal budget
10/03/23, 12:14 am - +91 88853 66406: U broke it then u should buy it.

10/03/23, 8:34 am - +91 84313 34677: 🤨 Does this policy apply to lifts and washing machines as well?
10/03/23, 8:46 am - +91 88853 66406: If u damage it, then should do..
10/03/23, 8:47 am - +91 84313 34677: How will that be assessed as to who broke it?
10/03/23, 8:47 am - +91 84313 34677: As much as I know there are no cctvs in our hostel
10/03/23, 8:53 am - +91 88853 66406: Students are needed privacy then how can install cctvs
10/03/23, 8:54 am - +91 88224 11339: <Media omitted>
10/03/23, 8:56 am - +91 84313 34677: Our administration is so inclined to give us students privacy that they are not at all involving in solving our problems. Mostly that also is a *private* problem!
10/03/23, 9:00 am - +91 88853 66406: This is in every one case. So, discuss here only about our hostel issues, it has to help in the implement of our hostel.
10/03/23, 9:02 am - +91 84313 34677: This was the issue being raised since I came to this hostel. I see the conviction and determination but I don’t see any implementation.
10/03/23, 9:02 am - +91 84313 34677: Hostel issue to which no one cared to reply!
10/03/23, 9:04 am - +91 84313 34677: This person did it by mistake and is admitting it. Establishment B fee is taken by IITM. Krishna hostel used it for Holi celebration this time I think. For what is our fees being used? Is our hostel so poor that it cannot even buy a new veggie cutter?
10/03/23, 9:04 am - +91 84313 34677: People can stop me anytime if I am not raising frustrating issues happening in our hostel
10/03/23, 9:05 am - +91 84313 34677: I never text abt problems in our hostel until recently. I always believed it will be taken care by our hostel admin. But I don’t see it happening.
10/03/23, 9:08 am - +91 84313 34677: I may be really harsh but its just the built up frustration of ~asking~ *begging* for good amenities and not getting them in our hostel
10/03/23, 9:13 am - +91 88853 66406: We can raise the complaint to repair or change the system. It happened.
10/03/23, 9:15 am - +91 84313 34677: Changed into better or worse system?
10/03/23, 9:15 am - +91 84313 34677: Now it looks more like a head chopper than a loft
10/03/23, 9:15 am - +91 84313 34677: Lift*
10/03/23, 9:16 am - +91 88853 66406: How the facilities addressed in our hostel if the implementation is not there.
10/03/23, 9:16 am - +91 88853 66406: Whoever will try to do better only not worse.
10/03/23, 9:17 am - +91 84313 34677: But it has started becoming worse recently right? I hear sometimes in my room how had the door hits. It makes a large sound.
10/03/23, 9:18 am - +91 84313 34677: Why are u so defensive as to not accept there are issues and push the manager to solve them.
10/03/23, 9:18 am - +91 84313 34677: U are a student rep brother not the manager rep
10/03/23, 9:19 am - +91 88853 66406: GBM not yet done. So, budget didn't get yet. Come to GBM then give ur suggestions definitely will include in our budget. Yesterday, souvik addressed some issues. Suggestions are needed by the students. Maximum 10 students only were attending to GBM.
10/03/23, 9:19 am - +91 84313 34677: Being addressed and getting nothing. I see whenever I open this group there are many people with issues of internet, washing machine, lift and everything
10/03/23, 9:20 am - +91 84313 34677: GBM does not cover small costs of repairs or replacement for veggie chopper?
10/03/23, 9:20 am - +91 88853 66406: I'm not defending with u. How do u know whether I did or not. Simply, how u can say about it?
10/03/23, 9:20 am - +91 84313 34677: Good quality one costs 300
10/03/23, 9:21 am - +91 84313 34677: I told to push the manager. Not only tell or ask.
10/03/23, 9:21 am - +91 84313 34677: If we are not stern he will not do the work
10/03/23, 9:21 am - +91 88853 66406: That's why I am giving response to u not to others brother.
10/03/23, 9:23 am - +91 88853 66406: See bro, if u don't tell also, it is happened. These issues are not a ignored things. So, simply don't blame on admin.
10/03/23, 9:23 am - +91 84313 34677: I need basic needs to live in our hostel bro. Not the responses which says its me who has to repair it. Student rep is the person who has to represent student and their issues and concerns to the administration. But here the opposite is happening is what my concern
10/03/23, 9:25 am - +91 84313 34677: Did I blame or raise a concern? I said these things are not taken care of. Today the lift worked. Kudos to you for getting it repaired. But many other issues are not addressed properly.
10/03/23, 9:27 am - +91 88853 66406: How do u can say bro. If we r not addressing to him what u told issues then how they r repaired. So, if washing machine is in repair, shall we need to buy new in ur sense? If lift is repaired, shall we need to put as a new one? Is it right way to utilise our budget?
10/03/23, 9:31 am - +91 88853 66406: That's why I'm telling bro. Response needed from students. That complaint should go to rise in the complaint book. Recently, one student rised an issue about washing machine base point. Then, immediately it changed. I think u didn't see it. If students rises then one can do it. Otherwise how? U rised issues so that we knew it. I informed immediately to engineering unit. It repaired. Tq
10/03/23, 9:55 am - +91 84313 34677: Okay bro. Thanks for all the repairs being done in our hostel and keeping things running smoothly! Maybe I’m the only person who raised some non existent issues in our hostel. All problems are addressed and tell me what to do if I see a problem.
10/03/23, 10:12 am - +91 85115 65232: Bro when the other people can get paid jersey??
10/03/23, 10:20 am - +91 96741 12479: I asked the vendor, he said he is busy!! On weekend will ask the vendor again!! At that time, fix the price and ask for payment!! I will let you know!!
10/03/23, 10:21 am - +91 85115 65232: Ok bro

10/03/23, 10:24 am - +91 94606 85411: See this concept is flawed with bigger items, and because everybody is using something it will require maintenance. If induction goes down someday it's slightly expensive
10/03/23, 10:24 am - +91 88853 66406: If u see a problem then address it bro. Don't ignore it. We have needed to establish our hostel. Definitely, support needed in this

10/03/23, 12:29 pm - +91 88224 11339: It's reasonable to expect that if someone damages an item, they should take responsibility for replacing it. Failing to do so can create a culture of neglect, where others may also start to mistreat shared facilities like restrooms or washing machines.
It's also true that hostel authorities sometimes try to ignore students' needs. For example, despite numerous requests, soap dispensers have not been installed in the restrooms. Additionally, the frequent breakdown of the lift is a serious cause for concern.
10/03/23, 1:55 pm - +91 89589 71338: I had raised the issue regarding filters in the GBM.   no action still.  No cold water in that.   I still get water from the mess

Title : Materials and interfaces in electrochemical energy conversion: understanding and control
Date/Time : 16-03-2023 4:00PM
Venue : NAC 2nd floor seminar hall (222)
Speaker: Prof. Dr. rer nat. Jan Philipp Hofmann

Biography of the Speaker :
Prof. Dr. rer nat. Jan Philipp Hofmann, Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.

Affiliation of the Speaker :
Affiliation: Surface Science Laboratory, Department of Materials and Earth Sciences, Technical University of Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.

Abstract :
Sustainable energy storage and conversion is key for transition to a CO2 neutral energy system. In this framework, solar energy conversion to and storage of the intermittently available electricity in chemical bonds, i.e. solar fuels, will play a major role in those transition technologies. To achieve the targeted terawatt scale, abundant, efficient/active and stable converter materials, i.e., photoabsorbers and electrocatalysts are needed.

17/03/23, 7:23 pm - +91 80746 21056: Do you think the tickets will be available offline 5 days before the match? I never went to a game so have no idea.
17/03/23, 7:24 pm - +91 83018 85364: I too don't know man.
17/03/23, 7:26 pm - +91 80746 21056: Okay, thanks bro. Pls let me know if somebody you know is planning to sell their tickets
17/03/23, 7:32 pm - +91 70088 70428: Last call for filling the form i will give the list to the vendor tomorrow morning
17/03/23, 7:36 pm - +91 94860 87050: Regarding Payments:

The final price is not fixed yet. It will be fixed after we get the exact counts and negotiation with vendor. 
The amount for Food (including extra tokens) will be deducted from iKollege like before. (We need some clarification on this from management side, will update it once we get to know about the procedure). 

(Before Covid, the amount fixed was around 450. Now we are expecting it around 550/600)
17/03/23, 7:38 pm - +91 97110 43649: Last time that food was worth ₹450!!!🤔🤐
17/03/23, 7:40 pm - +91 94860 87050: May I know what exactly your doubt bro?
17/03/23, 7:43 pm - +91 89470 69850: Yes, I think for the whole hostel it costed 450. Not per person
17/03/23, 7:44 pm - +91 89470 69850: 600 is also fine
17/03/23, 7:44 pm - +91 94860 87050: That amount is fixed 2 years before. How I can give justification to that now. I just share the information what I know, that's it. Before Covid, the BBQ Night costs 120, but last time costed 180. So that only I just said the range. Also, as said earlier *the exact amount is not yet fixed. Now I need the counts to get the quotation*. So everyone please fill the form at Security desk.
17/03/23, 7:44 pm - +91 97110 43649: 🤣

I hope everyone is having a fabulous weekend!!
Stress is something that everyone experiences, so learning how to cope with its effects is something that everyone needs to master for their own physical and psychological well-being. The main sources of stress. Mental, Social, Peers, Environmental, Physiological, etc.  



CDC-R came up with a session on "Stress management in day-to-day life " to guide you in handling all situations.



Our Speaker, Mr.KirthiBhai Astik, is an excellent coach and trainer, having conducted many workshops and talks to a distinct audience from various pillars of society such as teachers, police, security, doctors, students, etc. He regularly takes sessions as well as trains other volunteers for conducting workshops for colleges and corporates so that the message of Samarpan Meditation can spread to all humanity.

So don't miss out on this wonderful opportunity to learn stress management in a refined way.

26/03/23, 12:01 pm - +91 80053 64128: Use SoftEther vpn. It works. Don't circulate it to other hostels as they(i.e administration) will block this one too. Secondly you can use Tor(you have to download using your own internet) too, it works. Keep in mind Tor is quite slow.
